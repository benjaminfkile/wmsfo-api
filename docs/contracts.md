# WMSFO v2 shared contracts

This document is the interface every WMSFO v2 component codes against: the API (`wmsfo-api`), the public site, the admin panel, the Red-Nose beacon app, and the one-off migration tool. The design overview (`DESIGN.md`) is authoritative; this document makes it exact. Choices the overview does not make are listed in section 14, and choices that need the owner are in section 15. Nothing in the body is a choice that is not listed in one of those two sections.

## 0. Conventions

### 0.1 Placeholders

Every environment-specific value is written as a placeholder. Each placeholder has a dev value and a prod value.

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<gateway-domain>` | Public host of the gateway fleet. The hub is `wss://<gateway-domain>/hub`. |
| `<api-domain>` | Host that serves the API with bare paths (ALB host rule with URL rewrite). One per environment. |
| `<service>` | Manifest service name: `wmsfo-api` (prod) or `wmsfo-api-dev` (dev). Also the hub channel prefix. |
| `<cdn-domain>` | CloudFront distribution in front of the environment's bucket. |
| `<bucket>` | The environment's S3 bucket (private; read only by CloudFront through origin access control). |
| `<site-domain>` | Production public site origin host. |
| `<preview-site-domain>` | Preview (dev) public site origin host. |
| `<admin-domain>` | Admin panel origin host (deployed from `main`, targets prod). |
| `<admin-dev-domain>` | Admin panel origin host for dev (a second Vercel project deployed from `dev`). |
| `<pool-id>`, `<region>`, `<cognito-domain>` | Cognito user pool id, its region, and its hosted UI domain. |
| `<site-client-id>`, `<admin-client-id>` | Cognito app client ids. |
| `<account-id>` | AWS account id (ECR image path). |
| `<docker-bridge-ip>` | Address of the host's Docker bridge, where the gateway's internal listener answers on port 8080. |
| `<db-host>` | RDS endpoint or RDS proxy endpoint. |
| `<secret-name>` | Secrets Manager secret holding the API container env. |
| `<mail-domain>` | SES-verified sending domain. |

### 0.2 Wire format

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| JSON casing | camelCase on every wire (REST, hub, CDN objects). snake_case in SQL only. |
| Timestamps | RFC 3339, UTC, `Z` suffix, exactly three fractional digits on output: `2026-12-22T01:31:07.412Z`. Inputs accept any RFC 3339 offset and are normalized to UTC. Bare dates are rejected. Postgres `timestamptz` microseconds are truncated to milliseconds on output. |
| Ids | 64-bit integers serialized as JSON numbers. Identity columns start at 1 and never approach 2^53. Clients type them as `number` (TypeScript) or `Long` (Kotlin). |
| Units | metres (`altitudeM`, `accuracyM`), metres per second (`speedMps`), degrees (`lat`, `lng`, `headingDeg`). `headingDeg` is 0 to 360 inclusive, clockwise from true north. |
| Numbers | IEEE doubles. `NaN` and infinities are rejected on input. Doubles are written in .NET's shortest round-trippable form (the System.Text.Json default). |
| Money | `amountDonated` is a JSON number with at most two decimals, parsed by the API as `decimal` straight from the number token (no double round trip) and written back with two decimals (`250.10`) through a converter that writes `decimal.Round(v, 2).ToString("F2", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)` as a raw number token. Clients display it and never compute with it. It appears only on admin surfaces. |
| Unknown fields | Rejected with `400 validation_failed` on every request body the API accepts (exceptions: nested telemetry keys in the heartbeat, section 4.2; the two gateway callback bodies, sections 2.4 and 2.5; the form body on `POST /subscriptions/unsubscribe`, section 4.3, which is ignored entirely). Clients tolerate unknown fields on every response and every CDN object. |
| Strings | UTF-8. Length limits count UTF-16 code units (JavaScript `string.length`, C# `string.Length`, Kotlin `String.length`). Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed before validation. |
| Booleans | JSON `true` and `false` only. |
| Nullability | Written as `type \| null` in field tables. A field that is not nullable is always present with a value. |
| Schema version | Every CDN JSON object carries `schemaVersion` (int) as its first key. It is `1`. The API changes it only for a non-additive change. A client that reads a value it does not know stops applying objects and shows its reload prompt. |

Type notation in field tables: `int64`, `int`, `number`, `string`, `bool`, `rfc3339`, `T[]`, `object`.

### 0.3 Error shape

Every non-2xx response from the API has `Content-Type: application/json` and this body:

```json
{
  "code": "validation_failed",
  "message": "lat must be between -90 and 90",
  "details": { "fields": { "lat": "must be between -90 and 90" } },
  "requestId": "0HN7Q2K3L9V4A:00000003"
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | `string` | One of the codes in section 4.7. Stable; clients switch on it. |
| `message` | `string` | Human readable, English, safe to show in the admin panel and Red-Nose's debug log. Never shown verbatim on the public site. |
| `details` | `object \| null` | Code-specific. `validation_failed` carries `fields` (field path to message). `rate_limited` carries `retryAfterSeconds`. |
| `requestId` | `string` | The ASP.NET Core trace identifier. Appears in the CloudWatch log line. |

A `429` also sets the `Retry-After` header (seconds). A `405` has no body. The two exceptions with an empty body are the `404` on the callback paths (section 3.5) and `405`.

### 0.4 Base URLs and paths

The API is reachable at two URLs that serve the same routes:

- `https://<gateway-domain>/<service>/<path>`: the gateway strips `/<service>` before the container sees the request.
- `https://<api-domain>/<path>`: bare paths.

All paths in this document are bare. Clients use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (site, admin) or the enrolled `apiBaseUrl` (Red-Nose) and append the bare path. There is no version prefix. The only path under `/api` is `/api/health`, because that is the path the gateway probes (section 4.1).

The API has no public read endpoint. The public reads the CDN objects in section 1 and nothing else.

### 0.5 Lookups on the wire

**Event status** (table `event_status`, fixed, never edited through the API):

| `statusId` | `name` | Page role at `/` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `planned` | `planned` |
| 2 | `scheduled` | `scheduled` (the countdown section counts to `scheduledAt`) |
| 3 | `live` | `live` (the page that holds the `map` section) |
| 4 | `ended` | `ended` |
| 5 | `cancelled` | `cancelled` |

The site renders one admin-composed page per status, plus the `no_event` page when `eventStatusId` is null (1.3a). There is no other grouping of statuses.

**Beacon role**: `"beacon"`, `"admin"`.

**Subscriber channel**: `"email"` (in use), `"sms"` (reserved; `400 validation_failed` in v1).

**Beacon socket state** (telemetry): `"connected"`, `"connecting"`, `"reconnecting"`, `"disconnected"`.

**Thermal status** (telemetry, Android PowerManager names): `"none"`, `"light"`, `"moderate"`, `"severe"`, `"critical"`, `"emergency"`, `"shutdown"`, `"unknown"`.

**Memory pressure** (telemetry): `"normal"`, `"moderate"`, `"low"`, `"critical"`, `"unknown"`.

**Eviction reason** (hub): `"auth_expired"`, `"service_removed"`.

**Outbox topic**: `event.status_changed`, `event.message_posted`, `subscription.verify`, `contact.received` (section 7.7).

---

## 1. Read model: the CDN objects

The public site reads exactly three JSON objects plus media and icon files from the CDN and never calls the API for reads (the one exception is the preview endpoint in 4.3, used only by the admin panel's preview frame). Everything a page renders comes from these objects or from the hub carrying the first of them.

### 1.1 Object inventory

| Key in `<bucket>` | Content | Written by | When | `Cache-Control` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `live/location.json` | Live object (1.2) | An API node | Every stored update from the active beacon; after every snapshot-affecting admin write; after cookie moderation while the event has status 3; once by an ingest node that observes a version change (1.8); on explicit republish; on first boot of an environment | `s-maxage=1, max-age=0` |
| `snapshots/{sha256}.json` | Snapshot (1.3) | The API node handling a snapshot-affecting admin write | Inside the write's transaction, before commit | `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| `routes/{sha256}.json` | Route (1.4) | The API node handling `POST /admin/routes`; the migration tool | Before the row insert | `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| `media/{mediaId}/{filename}` | An uploaded media asset (1.3b): sponsor logos, page images, uploaded icons | The admin panel, straight to S3 with a presigned PUT (4.5 Media); the migration tool | Before confirm; the object carries the tag `state=pending` until the API confirms it | `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| `media/{mediaId}/w{width}.webp` | Derived width variants of a raster asset (480, 960, 1600) | The API node handling the confirm | Inside the confirm | `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| `icons/{sha256}.svg` | One icon of the built-in library (1.3b) | The node that migrates on boot, once per library change | Under the migration lock | `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |

The bucket is private; CloudFront reads it through origin access control and is the only reader (1.7). Nothing under any other prefix is written by v2. `{sha256}` is the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the object bytes (canonical bytes for JSON, section 1.6; the file bytes for icons). `{mediaId}` is the asset's UUID; `{filename}` is the uploaded name sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, at most 100 characters.

`Content-Type` is `application/json; charset=utf-8` for JSON, `image/svg+xml` for SVG, the sniffed type for raster uploads, `image/webp` for variants. All JSON is written minified.

The API never reads any of these objects back. The database is the source of truth; the objects are projections.

### 1.2 Live object: `live/location.json` and the hub `location` event

The API hands the same bytes to the CDN PUT and to the hub publish (section 2.6). The site holds exactly one copy in its store and replaces it by the rules below whichever path delivered it.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "eventId": 7,
  "eventStatusId": 3,
  "pollIntervalMs": 5000,
  "snapshotUrl": "https://<cdn-domain>/snapshots/3f9a1c...b2e1.json",
  "cookieTally": { "1": 412, "3": 90 },
  "seq": 1832,
  "lat": 46.87,
  "lng": -114.0,
  "speedMps": 31.2,
  "altitudeM": 1210,
  "headingDeg": 84,
  "accuracyM": 6,
  "recordedAt": "2026-12-22T01:31:07.000Z",
  "receivedAt": "2026-12-22T01:31:07.412Z",
  "publishedAt": "2026-12-22T01:31:07.430Z"
}
```

Keys appear in this order.

| Field | Type | Null when | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | `int` | never | `1` |
| `eventId` | `int64 \| null` | no event is current | The current event (1.3 defines "current"). |
| `eventStatusId` | `int \| null` | `eventId` is null | Status of the current event. The site's page switch. |
| `pollIntervalMs` | `int` | never | CDN poll cadence floor. From setting `poll_interval_ms`. |
| `snapshotUrl` | `string` | never (a snapshot always exists after first boot) | Absolute CDN URL of the current snapshot. Changes only when the snapshot is rebuilt with different content. |
| `cookieTally` | `object` | never (`{}` when no cookies or no event) | Keys are cookie type ids as decimal strings, emitted in ascending numeric id order; values are `int` counts of non-hidden cookies on the current event. A type with zero cookies is absent; the site fills zeros from `snapshot.cookieTypes`. |
| `seq` | `int64 \| null` | the current event has no published location | Arrival sequence of the location fields below, per event, strictly increasing. |
| `lat`, `lng` | `number \| null` | same as `seq` | Degrees. |
| `speedMps`, `altitudeM`, `headingDeg`, `accuracyM` | `number \| null` | same as `seq`, or the update carried null | Units per 0.2. |
| `recordedAt` | `rfc3339 \| null` | same as `seq` | The fix time the beacon sent. Informational; it never decides anything. |
| `receivedAt` | `rfc3339 \| null` | same as `seq` | When the API stored the update. |
| `publishedAt` | `rfc3339` | never | When this object was built. Used for the "last update" display and the tie-break below. |

Rules:

- The location fields are the latest `location` row with `published = true` on the current event. Switching the active beacon leaves these fields as they are until the newly active beacon's first update arrives.
- `cookieTally` is the count of non-hidden cookies on the current event at the time the object is built while the event's status is 1, 2, 3, or 5. On entry into status 4 the counts are copied to `event.final_cookie_tally` and every later live object for that event carries that column unchanged. Cookie moderation (hide, unhide, delete) writes the object only while the event has status 3 (1.8).
- Apply rule on the site, for an incoming object `L` when `store.live` exists (when it does not, replace):
  - `L.eventId !== store.live.eventId`: replace only when `L.publishedAt > store.live.publishedAt`.
  - Same event, `store.live.seq !== null`, and `L.seq === null`: discard. Within one event the location fields never go from present to absent.
  - Same event, both `seq` values non-null, and `L.seq < store.live.seq`: discard.
  - Same event, `L.seq === store.live.seq` (or both null), and `L.publishedAt <= store.live.publishedAt`: discard.
  - Otherwise replace.

  `publishedAt` comparisons are ordinal string comparisons; the canonical format (fixed width, three fractional digits, `Z`) makes that equivalent to time order. This makes the hub and the poll safe to mix for a browser that already holds the newer object; the CDN copy is corrected by the rewrite rule in 7.4, because an ingest PUT built before a status change can land after the admin node's PUT.
- Nothing on this object is derived by the site except the page choice from `eventStatusId`.

### 1.3 Snapshot: `snapshots/{sha256}.json`

"Current event" is the event whose `is_current` flag is true. The admin sets it explicitly (`POST /admin/events/{id}/current`); at most one event is current (partial unique index); only the current event can be set live; the flag cannot be moved while the current event is live. `event` is `null` in the snapshot and `eventId` is null on the live object when no event is current.

Keys appear in this order.

| Field | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | `int` | `1` |
| `event` | `object \| null` | The current event; `null` when none is current. |
| `event.id`, `event.year`, `event.name`, `event.statusId` | `int64`, `int`, `string`, `int` | As stored. |
| `event.scheduledAt` | `rfc3339 \| null` | Admin-entered. Countdown target when `statusId` is 2. |
| `event.wentLiveAt` | `rfc3339 \| null` | Stamped by the API on every entry into status 3; admin-patchable. Liftoff timer origin. |
| `event.endedAt` | `rfc3339 \| null` | Stamped by the API on every entry into status 4; admin-patchable. |
| `event.fundsPercent` | `int` | 0 to 100. Cheer meter. |
| `event.routeUrl` | `string \| null` | Absolute CDN URL of the event's route; `null` when unlinked. |
| `event.latestMessage` | `object \| null` | The `event_message` with the greatest `created_at` for this event (not `eventTime`; ties on `created_at` broken by greatest `id`), or `null`. |
| `event.latestMessage.id`, `body`, `eventTime`, `createdAt` | `int64`, `string`, `rfc3339 \| null`, `rfc3339` | As stored. |
| `sponsors[]` | `object[]` | Sponsors having a `sponsor_year` row with `event_year = event.year`, `active = true`, `anonymous = false`, `can_advertise = true`; ordered `amount_donated` desc (nulls last), `name` asc, `id` asc. Empty when `event` is null. |
| `sponsors[].websiteUrl`, `fbUrl`, `igUrl` | `string \| null` | As stored. |
| `sponsors[].logoMediaId` | `string \| null` | The sponsor's logo as a media asset id, resolved through `media`; `null` when no logo. |
| `sponsors[].latestYear` | `int` | Greatest `event_year` among the sponsor's rows. |
| `sponsors[].yearsAsSponsor` | `int` | Count of distinct `event_year` rows for the sponsor. |
| `sponsors[].lingerMs` | `int` | `max(sponsor_linger_min_ms, round(amount_donated * sponsor_linger_ms_per_dollar))`; `sponsor_linger_min_ms` alone when `amount_donated` is null. |
| `cookieTypes[]` | `object[]` | Rows with `active = true`, ordered `sort` asc, `id` asc. |
| `cookieTypes[].id`, `name`, `icon`, `sort` | `int64`, `string`, `Icon \| null`, `int` | As stored; `icon` is the value type in 1.3a. |
| `content` | `object` | The published content document (1.3a), byte for byte the `document` of the newest `content_version` row. Never null after first boot. |
| `media` | `object` | Map of media asset id to `MediaEntry` (1.3b) for every asset referenced by `content`, by a sponsor in `sponsors[]`, or by a cookie type in `cookieTypes[]`. Keys in ascending string order. |
| `icons` | `object` | Map of library icon id to absolute CDN URL for the whole built-in library (1.3b). Keys in ascending string order. |

The snapshot row's `version` and `built_at` stay on the row and on `GET /admin/snapshot`; they are not part of the object, so two rebuilds with identical data produce identical bytes. Amounts donated never appear in any public object. The snapshot never contains cookie notes, person data, beacon data, telemetry, or donation amounts.

A snapshot-affecting write is any admin write to: `event` (create, update, delete, status, current, route link), `event_message`, `sponsor`, `sponsor_year`, `cookie_type`, any `app_setting` key, a media asset's `alt` (it rides in `media`), and a content publish (4.5 Content). Working-set writes (pages, sections, items, site settings draft) and media uploads are not snapshot-affecting; nothing reaches the site until a publish. Section 7.3 gives the transaction.

### 1.3a Content document

The content document is what an editor publishes: site settings plus pages made of sections. It lives in `content_version.document` and rides in the snapshot as `content`. Instances are data; kinds are code: the site holds one React component and one JSON Schema per section kind and per block kind, and renders whatever the document says, skipping any kind it does not know.

```ts
type ContentDocument = { schemaVersion: 1; settings: SiteSettings; pages: ContentPage[] };
type PageRole = "none" | "no_event" | "planned" | "scheduled" | "live" | "ended" | "cancelled";
type ContentPage = { id: number; slug: string; title: string; navLabel: string | null; navPosition: number; role: PageRole; sections: ContentSection[] };
type ContentSection = { id: number; kind: string; presentation: Presentation; data: object; items: ContentItem[] };
type ContentItem = { id: number; data: object };
```

Pages appear in `navPosition` asc, `id` asc; sections in `position` asc, `id` asc; items likewise. Hidden pages, hidden sections, and hidden items are omitted at publish; the document carries only what renders. Exactly one page per non-`none` role is present (the six are created by the seed and cannot be deleted, 4.5 Pages). A role page renders at `/` when its role matches `live.eventStatusId` (`no_event` when null); a `none` page renders at `/<slug>`. A role page's `navLabel` is always null; the home entry of the nav is site code, labelled by `settings.homeNavLabel`, linking to `/`.

**Shared primitives**, defined once in `contracts/schema/primitives.schema.json` and referenced by every kind:

```ts
type Icon = { source: "library"; id: string } | { source: "media"; id: string };
  // library: an id from the icons map; media: the id of a ready media asset of kind "svg"
type MediaRef = { mediaId: string; alt: string | null };      // alt null means the asset's own alt
type Link = { label: Inline; href: string; icon: Icon | null; newTab: boolean };
  // href: absolute http or https URL, a mailto: address, or a site path starting with "/" (a page slug, optionally "#anchor")
type Inline = string;                                          // constrained inline markdown, below; 1 to 5000 characters

```

**Inline markdown.** `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `\`code\``, `[label](href)` with the same href rules as `Link`, a line break as a newline character, an icon as `{icon:<library-id>}` or `{icon:media:<mediaId>}`, and the placeholders `{event:name}`, `{event:year}`, `{event:scheduledAt}` (filled from `snapshot.event`; blank when there is no current event; `scheduledAt` formatted by the site in `America/Denver`). Everything else is literal text. No raw HTML is stored or rendered; the site's inline parser produces React elements, never `innerHTML`.

**Section kinds.** One schema per kind at `contracts/schema/sections/<kind>.schema.json` (data) and, for kinds with items, `<kind>.item.schema.json`. `live` kinds carry configuration and read the live object and the snapshot; `content` kinds carry everything they render.

| Kind | Live | `data` | Items | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rich_text` | no | `{ blocks: Block[] }` (1 to 200) | none | |
| `hero` | no | `{ title: Inline; tagline: Inline \| null; icon: Icon \| null; links: Link[]; height: "short" \| "tall" }` (`links` 0 to 2) | none | the background image is `presentation.background` with `kind: "media"`, like any section |
| `media` | no | `{ layout: "single" \| "grid" \| "carousel"; columns: 2 \| 3 \| 4 }` | `{ media: MediaRef; caption: Inline \| null; link: Link \| null }` (1 to 50) | |
| `links` | no | `{ heading: Inline \| null; style: "buttons" \| "cards" \| "list" }` | `{ link: Link; description: Inline \| null }` (1 to 50) | |
| `icon_row` | no | `{ size: "sm" \| "md" \| "lg"; spacing: "tight" \| "normal" \| "loose" }` | `{ icon: Icon; label: Inline \| null }` (1 to 30) | |
| `divider` | no | `{ style: "line" \| "snowflakes" \| "lights" }` | none | |
| `funds_ring` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; caption: Inline \| null; size: "small" \| "large"; showYear: boolean }` | none | reads `snapshot.event.fundsPercent`, `year`; 0 and no year when `event` is null |
| `countdown` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null }` | none | reads `snapshot.event.scheduledAt`; renders nothing unless `live.eventStatusId` is 2 and `now < scheduledAt` |
| `event_times` | yes | `{ fields: ("scheduledAt" \| "wentLiveAt" \| "endedAt" \| "airborneFor")[]; labels: { scheduledAt: Inline; wentLiveAt: Inline; endedAt: Inline; airborneFor: Inline } }` (`fields` 1 to 4, distinct) | none | each field renders only when its value exists; `airborneFor` is the elapsed time since `wentLiveAt` while status is 3 |
| `latest_message` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; style: "card" \| "ticker" }` | none | reads `snapshot.event.latestMessage`; renders nothing when null |
| `map` | yes | `{ themes: string[]; defaultTheme: string; defaultCenter: { lat: number; lng: number }; defaultZoom: number; controls: { themePicker: boolean; terrain: boolean; snow: boolean; routeLines: boolean; timeLabels: boolean; location: boolean; dataRow: boolean }; overlays: { liveIndicator: boolean; liftoffTimer: boolean; latestMessage: boolean; leaderboardPanel: boolean; sponsorCarousel: boolean; cookieControl: boolean; distanceChip: boolean } }` (`themes` 1 to 10 from the site's theme registry; `defaultTheme` in `themes`; `defaultZoom` 3 to 18) | none | allowed only on the page with role `live`; reads the live object and the route; the full-viewport live screen of site.md section 8 |
| `leaderboard` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; variant: "panel" \| "full"; emptyText: Inline }` | none | reads `live.cookieTally` joined with `snapshot.cookieTypes` |
| `sponsor_carousel` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; logoWidth: 480 \| 960 }` | none | reads `snapshot.sponsors` and `lingerMs` |
| `sponsor_grid` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; columns: 2 \| 3 \| 4; showYears: boolean; emptyText: Inline }` | none | reads `snapshot.sponsors` |
| `route_preview` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; style: "svg" \| "map"; emptyText: Inline }` | none | reads `route`; `svg` draws the points without the Maps script; `map` is the route viewer of site.md section 8 |
| `cookie_control` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; copy: Inline \| null; signedOutCopy: Inline; closedCopy: Inline }` | none | the leave-a-cookie control; `signedOutCopy` when signed out; `closedCopy` when `live.eventStatusId` is not 3 |
| `alerts_signup` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; copy: Inline \| null; signedOutCopy: Inline }` | none | the subscription manager of 4.4 when signed in; `signedOutCopy` and a sign-in link otherwise |
| `contact_form` | yes | `{ heading: Inline \| null; copy: Inline \| null; successText: Inline }` | none | posts `POST /contact` |

**Site settings** (`contracts/schema/site-settings.schema.json`):

```ts
type SiteSettings = {
  siteName: Inline;                          // required
  tagline: Inline | null;
  homeNavLabel: Inline;                      // required; the nav entry for "/"
  logo: Icon | null;
  favicon: Icon | null;
  theme: { accent: "red" | "green" | "gold" | "blue"; surface: "night" | "snow" | "forest"; fontPairing: "classic" | "festive" | "modern"; snowDefault: boolean };
  navExtraLinks: Link[];                     // 0 to 5, appended after the pages
  footerLinks: Link[];                       // 0 to 10
  footerText: Inline | null;
  contactEmail: string | null;               // shown on the site; the API's notification inbox is configuration
  donateUrl: string | null;                  // absolute https URL
  analyticsEnabled: boolean;
};
```

**Validation, two levels.** The panel and the API run the same schemas. *Draft* validation, applied to every working-set write, is the kind's schema with `required`, `minLength`, `minItems`, and `minimum` removed at every level: types, enums, and unknown properties are enforced, incompleteness is not, and references are not checked. *Publish* validation, applied by `POST /admin/content/publish` and reported by `GET /admin/content/status`, is the full schema plus: every `MediaRef` and media-sourced `Icon` names a media asset with `state = ready` (and kind `svg` for icons); every library icon id exists; every `Link.href` and inline link matches the href rule; a site path href names an existing, non-hidden page slug; `anchor` values are unique within a page; `map` sections sit only on the `live` page; `settings` satisfies its schema. Problems are reported as `{ path, message }` with `path` a JSON pointer inside the section's `data` or `presentation`, the item's `data`, or the settings.

**Extensibility rules.** A new section or block kind is one schema file, one registry entry, and one component on each side; nothing else changes. New optional fields are added to a schema with a default and need no migration, no republish, and no panel change (forms are generated from the schemas). The primitives are the only shared vocabulary; a kind never invents its own shape for an icon, a link, a media reference, or text. `schemaVersion` on the document changes only when a published document could no longer be read by the previous site; the site treats an unknown value like an unknown snapshot version (1.9).

### 1.3b Media map and icon map

```ts
type MediaEntry = {
  url: string;                               // the uploaded object, absolute CDN URL
  kind: "raster" | "svg" | "gif";
  width: number | null; height: number | null;   // pixels; null for svg
  alt: string;                               // the asset's alt text, may be empty
  variants: { [width: string]: string };     // "480", "960", "1600": absolute CDN URLs of the WebP variants that exist; {} for svg and gif
};
```

A variant exists only when the source is a raster image wider than that width; a 700 px upload has `variants: { "480": ... }`. The site renders a `MediaRef` as `<img>` with `srcset` from the variants plus the original at its own width and `sizes` from the section's width; it never constructs a media URL and never inlines SVG. Nothing in v2 overwrites or invalidates a media object.

The icon library is a directory of SVG files in the API repository, `icons/<id>.svg`, each with a name and tags in `icons/library.json`. `icons` in the snapshot maps every id to `https://<cdn-domain>/icons/{sha256}.svg`. The library is written to the bucket by the migrating node under the migration lock whenever its hash differs from `icon_library_state.library_sha256`, followed by a snapshot rebuild, so a deploy that adds icons needs no operator action. Uploaded icons are media assets of kind `svg` and resolve through `media`. Every SVG, library or uploaded, passes the validator in 4.5 Media and renders through `<img>` only.

### 1.4 Route: `routes/{sha256}.json`

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "name": "2025 flight",
  "points": [
    { "lat": 46.8721, "lng": -114.0012, "recordedAt": "2025-12-22T01:31:07.000Z" },
    { "lat": 46.8730, "lng": -114.0030, "recordedAt": null }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | `int` | `1`; written by the API, absent from the upload body |
| `name` | `string` | required, 1 to 200 |
| `points[]` | `object[]` | required, 2 to 50,000 items (about 3.5 MB minified, under the 5 MB body limit); array order is the route order |
| `points[].lat`, `points[].lng` | `number` | required, finite, in range |
| `points[].recordedAt` | `rfc3339 \| null` | required key; the time label for the point, `null` when unknown |

No other keys anywhere. The stored object is the canonical re-serialization (1.6), not the uploaded bytes. The upload body is `{ name, points }`; the object adds `schemaVersion` first. Upload limit 5 MB; the byte limit is checked first (`413`), then the item count (`400`).

### 1.5 Images

Every image on the site is a media asset or a library icon resolved through `snapshot.media` and `snapshot.icons` (1.3b). The site never constructs image URLs and renders SVG only through `<img>` elements, never inline. A reference that resolves to nothing (an id missing from the map) renders nothing and logs once.

### 1.6 Canonical JSON and hashing

Every JSON object the API or the migration tool writes to the bucket is produced by one serializer configuration:

- System.Text.Json; `PropertyNamingPolicy = CamelCase`; `WriteIndented = false`; nulls written (`DefaultIgnoreCondition = Never`); the default encoder; properties in the order documented in this section (the DTO declares them in that order); `cookieTally` keys written in ascending numeric order; doubles in shortest round-trippable form; timestamps through the converter in 0.2 (three fractional digits, `Z`); no trailing newline; UTF-8 without BOM.
- `sha256` is computed over exactly those bytes, and exactly those bytes are uploaded.
- The migration tool is a project in the API solution that references the API's DTO types and serializer options, so a route object it writes is byte-identical to what the API would write for the same data.
- No other component ever re-serializes a CDN object for hashing; the site and Red-Nose only parse.
- Two snapshot rebuilds with identical data yield the same key and URL; `version` still increments and the `snapshot` row is rewritten. A route upload whose canonical bytes hash to an existing route's key returns that route (section 4.5).

### 1.7 CDN and bucket configuration

- **Bucket access**: private. Block Public Access fully on; the bucket policy grants `s3:GetObject` only to the CloudFront service principal for this distribution (origin access control, platform.md 1.3). Direct S3 URLs answer `403`. Beacon logs go to Postgres; nothing in the bucket is sensitive, but nothing bypasses the CDN either.
- **Bucket CORS**: one rule for the admin panel's presigned uploads only: origins the admin origins, methods `PUT`, allowed headers `Content-Type`, `x-amz-tagging`, exposed header `ETag`, max age 3600. Every read goes through the distribution and CORS headers for reads come from it (below), never from S3.
- **Lifecycle rules**: expire objects tagged `state=pending` after 1 day and objects tagged `state=orphaned` after 7 days (4.5 Media). Nothing else expires.
- **Distribution**: allowed methods `GET`, `HEAD` only; no headers, query strings, or cookies in the cache key; cache policy honouring origin `Cache-Control`, min TTL 0, default TTL 1 s, max TTL 31,536,000 s; compression on (gzip and brotli) for `application/json` and `image/svg+xml`; Origin Shield on in the bucket's region; HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 on; error caching minimum TTL 1 s for 403, 404, 500, 502, 503, 504; a response headers policy with CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, allowed methods `GET, HEAD`, allowed headers `*`, max age 3600, override on, plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. One cached copy of every object per edge; the live object is cached once per second worldwide.
- **Browser fetch**: default cache mode and `credentials: "omit"` everywhere. The browser revalidates `live/location.json` (`max-age=0`) and CloudFront answers `304` when unchanged. The site never appends query strings to CDN URLs.
- **Uploads**: the admin panel PUTs media bytes straight to the bucket's S3 endpoint with a presigned URL (15 minutes) that fixes the key, the `Content-Type`, and the `x-amz-tagging: state=pending` header; the instance role signs. Nothing else writes to the bucket from outside the fleet.

### 1.8 Who writes the live object, and when

Every write of the live object is one S3 `PutObject` of the whole object and one hub publish of the same bytes. The publish is attempted whether or not the PUT succeeded. On a PUT failure the CDN lags until the next successful PUT while the hub carries the current point; the apply rule (1.2) discards the older polled object. Exactly these triggers write it, and only the node named:

| Trigger | Node | Source of the fields |
|---|---|---|
| A stored location with `published = true` | The node that stored it | The location transaction (7.2) reads the event row it locked and the `snapshot` row, so the object built inside the transaction carries the status and `snapshotUrl` of that moment |
| A committed snapshot-affecting write (including every settings write and every status change) | The node that committed it | Refreshed from SQL after commit |
| Cookie moderation (hide, unhide, delete) while the event has status 3 | The node that took the write | Tally re-read from SQL after commit |
| A version change observed on the reconcile tick, by a node that wrote the object for a stored location since the previous version change it observed | That node, once | Refreshed from SQL on the tick (7.4) |
| `POST /admin/live/republish` | The node that took the request | Refreshed from SQL |
| First boot of an environment (no `snapshot` row) | The node that built snapshot version 1 | Refreshed from SQL |

Any other node that observes a version change on the reconcile tick refreshes memory only; it never writes the object and never publishes. The origin is therefore written by the ingest node (every fix, while live, plus one rewrite when it sees a version change) and by the admin node (once per admin write). The site's apply rule (1.2) resolves the same-second overlap for a browser; the ingest node's rewrite corrects the CDN copy when its PUT built before a status change lands after the admin node's PUT.

Writes are coalesced per node: if a write is in flight, the next one waits and then writes whatever is current in memory. On the ingest path a CDN write failure is logged and the beacon's response is still `2xx` (the row is stored; the next update retries the object). On the admin path the PUT is retried three times one second apart; the admin response is sent after commit and does not wait for the live-object write. After every live-object attempt the writing node updates the single `live_state` row (section 5): success sets `last_write_at`, `last_write_seq`, `last_write_version`, `last_write_node` and clears `last_write_error`; a final failure sets `last_write_error`. `GET /admin/live` returns that row fleet-wide, and the panel's dashboard poll surfaces `lastWriteError`. Publishes are best-effort (section 2.6).

### 1.9 The site's data loop

One store, one loop. Nothing else on the site fetches anything.

```ts
type Store = {
  live: LiveObject | null;
  snapshot: Snapshot | null;
  snapshotUrl: string | null;        // the URL store.snapshot was fetched from
  route: Route | null;
  routeUrl: string | null;           // the URL store.route was fetched from
  hub: "connecting" | "connected" | "reconnecting" | "disconnected";
                                     // "connected" is set on the `joined` ack for `<service>:location`,
                                     // not when start() resolves; start() resolving leaves it "connecting"
  lastHubLocationAt: number | null;  // performance.now() of the last hub `location` event
  lastSeqChangeAt: number | null;    // performance.now() when an applied object carried a `seq` different
                                     // from the previous one; set on the first apply too
  schemaMismatch: boolean;           // true once an unknown schemaVersion was seen
};
```

Startup:

1. `GET <cdn>/live/location.json`. On failure retry after 1 s, 2 s, 3 s, then every 5 s; render a loading state until the first success.
2. Apply it (below), which fetches `snapshotUrl` and then `routeUrl`.
3. Start the hub connection (section 2.2) and the poll timer.

Apply a live object `L` (from either path):

- If `L.schemaVersion !== 1`: set `schemaMismatch`, show the reload prompt, apply nothing further. The same check applies to a fetched snapshot or route: `schemaVersion !== 1` sets `schemaMismatch`, shows the reload prompt, and the object is not stored; so does `snapshot.content.schemaVersion !== 1`.
- Discard per the rule in 1.2 (an older event, a lower `seq`, a null `seq` after a non-null one, or an older `publishedAt` on equal `seq`); otherwise `store.live = L`, and when `L.seq` differs from the previous `seq` (or this is the first apply) set `lastSeqChangeAt = performance.now()`.
- If `L.snapshotUrl !== store.snapshotUrl`: fetch it; on success `store.snapshot = S; store.snapshotUrl = L.snapshotUrl`. On failure retry with the same backoff; keep rendering the old snapshot meanwhile.
- Let `routeUrl = store.snapshot?.event?.routeUrl ?? null`. If `routeUrl !== store.routeUrl`: fetch it (or set `store.route = null` when `routeUrl` is null) and set `store.routeUrl = routeUrl`.

Poll timer:

- Quiet is defined only while `live.eventStatusId === 3`: `hub !== "connected"`, or `lastHubLocationAt === null`, or `now - lastHubLocationAt > 2 * live.pollIntervalMs`. Outside status 3 the hub is never quiet.
- Cadence is `live.pollIntervalMs` when not quiet; `max(1000, live.pollIntervalMs / 2)` when quiet. Tightened polling applies only while live.
- Each tick fetches `live/location.json` and applies it. The timer is re-armed after each fetch completes (no overlapping fetches). A `403`, `404`, `5xx`, or network failure on a poll keeps the current store and waits for the next tick.
- When the document is hidden the site keeps the hub connection and stops polling; on becoming visible it polls immediately and resumes.

Hub `location` event: apply its `data` as a live object and set `lastHubLocationAt`.

Page choice at `/`: `live.eventStatusId` picks the role per the table in 0.5 (`null` is `no_event`) and the site renders the page in `snapshot.content.pages` with that role. The switch happens the moment the live object is applied; until the snapshot named by the new `snapshotUrl` arrives the site keeps rendering the page it has for the new role from the snapshot it holds (the pages rarely change between snapshots; only the event fields do). While `(store.snapshot?.event?.statusId ?? null) !== live.eventStatusId` (the snapshot named by the new `snapshotUrl` is still in flight) the time-shaped elements (`countdown`, liftoff timer, end time) render blank; they fill on the snapshot's arrival. When both are null there are no time-shaped elements.

Live-screen states while status 3: `seq === null` renders the map with the route and a "waiting for the first fix" marker state. `seq !== null && performance.now() - lastSeqChangeAt > 30000` renders the signal-lost indicator on the marker; the marker stays where it is.

### 1.10 Field map per surface

Content kinds read only their own `data` and `items` plus `snapshot.media` and `snapshot.icons`. Live kinds read as 1.3a lists. The site-coded surfaces:

| Surface | Reads |
|---|---|
| Shell (nav, footer, theme, favicon, snow default) | `snapshot.content.settings`, `snapshot.content.pages[]` (`navLabel`, `navPosition`, `slug`) |
| Page at `/` | the page whose `role` matches `live.eventStatusId` |
| Page at `/<slug>` | the `none` page with that slug; unknown slug renders the not-found page |
| Every inline text | `snapshot.event.name`, `year`, `scheduledAt` for the placeholders |
| Live screen (`map` section) | `live.lat/lng/headingDeg/speedMps/altitudeM/accuracyM/receivedAt/recordedAt/publishedAt`, `route.points`, `snapshot.event.wentLiveAt`, `live.cookieTally` with `snapshot.cookieTypes`, `snapshot.sponsors` with `lingerMs`, `snapshot.event.latestMessage`, `store.hub` and quiet state |
| Alerts landing pages `/alerts/verify`, `/alerts/unsubscribe` | `token` from the query string, then `POST /subscriptions/verify` or `POST /subscriptions/unsubscribe` (section 4.3) |
| `alerts_signup` (signed in) | `GET /me`, `GET /me/subscriptions` (section 4.4) |
| `cookie_control` (signed in, status 3) | `snapshot.cookieTypes`, `GET /me/cookies`, `POST /cookies` |
| `contact_form` | `POST /contact` |
| `/preview` | `GET /preview/document?token=` (4.3) in place of `snapshot.content`, `media`, `icons` |

Leaderboard rendering: for each `snapshot.cookieTypes[]` entry, count is `live.cookieTally[String(id)] ?? 0`; sort by count descending, then `sort`, then `id`; the type's `icon` resolves through `icons` or `media`.

### 1.11 The admin panel's data loop

The admin panel does not use the hub. It reads the API and, on its dashboard, one CDN object.

| View | Fetches on entry | Polls while visible | After a write |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `GET /admin/events`, `GET /admin/live`, `GET <cdn>/live/location.json`, `GET /admin/snapshot`, `GET /admin/beacons` | every 5 s: `GET /admin/live`, `GET <cdn>/live/location.json`, `GET /admin/beacons` | refetch all |
| Beacons | `GET /admin/beacons` | every 5 s: `GET /admin/beacons` | refetch |
| Pages, page editor, media library, site settings, publish | their list or detail endpoint; the page editor also `GET /admin/content/kinds` and `GET /admin/icons` once per session | none | the write response is the fresh row; the publish view refetches `GET /admin/content/status` after every working-set write |
| Every other view | its list endpoint | none | refetch the list; the write response is the fresh row |

Polling stops while the document is hidden and resumes with an immediate fetch on visible. Every API fetch carries the current ID token (section 3.1). The CDN fetch of `live/location.json` is a plain GET with `credentials: "omit"`, `cache: "no-store"`, and no custom headers, per 1.7.

Published-state card. The dashboard compares the CDN object with the API: `cdn.eventStatusId` against the current event's `statusId` from `GET /admin/events`; `cdn.snapshotUrl` against `GET /admin/snapshot` `url`; `cdn.seq` against `GET /admin/live` `lastWriteSeq`. A mismatch that persists across two consecutive polls renders red with the text "CDN behind" and a Republish button that calls `POST /admin/live/republish`. `lastWriteError` from `GET /admin/live`, when non-null, renders red with the same button.

Out-of-range colouring on the beacons view, from `Beacon.telemetry`, the row, and `staleAfterS` on the beacons response (constants in `contracts/admin-thresholds.json`, section 13):

| Condition | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Battery low | `power.batteryPercent < 20` |
| No recent fix | `gps.lastFixAgeS > 30`, or `lastLocationAt` older than 30 s while an event is live |
| Permission missing | any of `gps.permission.foreground`, `.background`, `.precise` is false |
| Socket down | `hubConnected === false`, or `hubConnected === null` and `transport.socketState !== "connected"` |
| Stale | `staleSince !== null` |
| Heartbeat old | `lastHeartbeatAt` older than `staleAfterS` |

Before sending `POST /admin/events/{id}/status` with `statusId: 3`, the panel shows a confirmation naming the active beacon (or "none"), its heartbeat age, and its stale flag from the beacons list it already holds. Before `POST /admin/beacons/{id}/rotate`, `/revoke`, or `/deactivate` on a beacon whose `isActive` is true while any event in `GET /admin/events` has `statusId` 3, the panel shows a confirmation stating that location fan-out stops until another beacon is activated (rotate: or this phone is re-enrolled with the new key). The API does not block on any of it; the admin decides.

---

## 2. Hub

The hub is the gateway's SignalR endpoint `wss://<gateway-domain>/hub`. WebSockets only, negotiation skipped, one client method `ChannelEvent`. The gateway delivers at most once with no replay; every hub event is a hint and the CDN object is the truth the site reconciles against.

Channel names are `<service>:<topic>`. `<service>` is the manifest service name (`wmsfo-api` in prod, `wmsfo-api-dev` in dev). The API reads it from `WMSFO_SERVICE_NAME`; the site reads it from `VITE_HUB_CHANNEL_PREFIX`; Red-Nose reads `ingestChannel` from its enrollment response.

### 2.1 Channels

All channels are private at the gateway level because `realtimeAuthPath` is set; the API's auth callback (2.4) decides per topic, and every client, the site included, handles `channelEvicted` (2.3).

| Channel | Who joins | Join method | Credential | `identity` returned | Events |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<service>:location` | Public site | `JoinChannel` | none (null) | none | `location` (published by the API) |
| `<service>:event` | Nobody in this version | `JoinChannel` | none | none | reserved; nothing published |
| `<service>:cookies` | Nobody in this version | `JoinChannel` | none | none | reserved; nothing published |
| `<service>:ingest` | Red-Nose (any enrolled beacon) | `JoinPrivateChannel(channel, key)` | beacon key | beacon id and key version as `"<id>:<version>"` | nothing published; carries the client message `location` |

Any other topic is denied. The admin panel does not use the hub.

### 2.2 Connecting

Browser (site), `@microsoft/signalr`:

```ts
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
  .withUrl(HUB_URL, { skipNegotiation: true, transport: signalR.HttpTransportType.WebSockets })
  .withAutomaticReconnect([1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000])
  .build();
connection.keepAliveIntervalInMilliseconds = 15000;
connection.serverTimeoutInMilliseconds = 30000;
```

`withAutomaticReconnect` with a finite array stops retrying after the array is exhausted; the site wraps `start()` in its own loop (1 s, 2 s, 3 s, then every 5 s forever) and treats `onclose` as "start again".

Red-Nose (Kotlin, official Java client):

```kotlin
val connection = HubConnectionBuilder.create(hubUrl)
    .withTransport(TransportEnum.WEBSOCKETS)
    .shouldSkipNegotiate(true)
    .build()
connection.keepAliveInterval = 15000
connection.serverTimeout = 30000
```

The Java client has no automatic reconnect; the service owns the loop (section 9).

Keep-alive alignment: the hub uses the SignalR server defaults (keep-alive ping every 15 s, client timeout 30 s); both clients keep the client defaults above; the load balancer idle timeout stays at or above 60 s.

### 2.3 Client lifecycle

1. Register `on("ChannelEvent", envelope => ...)` once and route on `envelope.channel` and `envelope.event`; register `onreconnected` and `onclose`. Handlers exist before the connection starts, so no envelope is dropped.
2. `start()`.
3. Join: site `invoke("JoinChannel", PREFIX + ":location")`; Red-Nose `invoke("JoinPrivateChannel", ingestChannel, beaconKey)`.
4. Expect the caller-only ack `{ channel, event: "joined", data: { channel } }`. The site uses its arrival to set `hub = "connected"` and turn on the live indicator; it is not an application event.
5. On `onreconnected`: join again (membership dies with the old connection id), then refetch truth: the site fetches `live/location.json` immediately; Red-Nose sends the current fix.
6. `channelEvicted` arrives as `{ channel: <evicted channel>, event: "channelEvicted", data: { channel, reason } }`. On `data.reason === "auth_expired"`: join that channel again (site: `JoinChannel` with no credential; Red-Nose: `JoinPrivateChannel` with the same key), then refetch truth. The gateway's allow for a join lasts about 15 minutes and is never renewed in the background; its sweep, about once a minute, evicts the connection from the channel once the allow has lapsed, and the client's re-join runs the auth callback again. Every client sees this regularly and treats it as routine.
7. On `data.reason === "service_removed"`: keep the connection, retry the join every 5 s.
8. A join that throws because it was denied waits 10 s before the first retry (the gateway caches the deny for about 10 s against the same credential and caps attempts per connection and channel per 10 s window); malformed and budget errors retry with the 1, 2, 3, 5 s backoff. The site keeps polling regardless; a permanently failing join only means the site runs on the CDN at the quiet cadence.
9. `onclose`: mark the hub disconnected (the site switches to the quiet cadence while live), then run the start loop again.

Every client holds exactly one connection and joins each of its channels once. The site ignores every envelope other than `location` on `<service>:location`, `joined`, and `channelEvicted`.

### 2.4 Auth callback (gateway to API)

Manifest `realtimeAuthPath` is `/realtime/authorize`. The gateway POSTs, with a 2 s timeout:

```
POST /realtime/authorize
Content-Type: application/json

{ "channel": "wmsfo-api:ingest", "credential": "wbk_...", "connectionId": "abc123" }
```

`credential` is null when the client used one-argument `JoinChannel`.

Rules, evaluated in this order:

| Condition | Response |
|---|---|
| The request carries `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, or `X-Forwarded-Proto` (it came through the public proxy, not from the gateway process) | `404`, empty body |
| Body malformed, or `channel` malformed | `200 { "allow": false }` |
| Prefix is not `WMSFO_SERVICE_NAME` | `200 { "allow": false }` |
| Topic `location`, `event`, or `cookies` | `200 { "allow": true }`; credential ignored (null or any string); `identity` omitted; zero I/O |
| Topic `ingest` and `credential` matches the key regex (3.2) and a `beacon` row has `key_hash = sha256(credential)` with `revoked_at is null` | `200 { "allow": true, "identity": "<beaconId>:<keyVersion>" }` (`beacon.id` and `beacon.key_version`, decimal, colon-separated); stamp `beacon.last_seen_at = now()` |
| Topic `ingest` otherwise | `200 { "allow": false }` |
| Any other topic | `200 { "allow": false }` |

Unknown fields in the callback body are ignored (0.2). The handler answers within 2 seconds; the only I/O is one indexed lookup plus the `last_seen_at` stamp on the ingest branch. The public-topic branch does no I/O, is exempt from the rate limiter, and logs at Debug only, because every site connection re-joins roughly every 15 minutes (100,000 connections produce about 110 callbacks per second in steady state plus join bursts at page-load peaks). The credential is never logged.

### 2.5 Message path (gateway to API)

Manifest `realtimeMessagePath` is `/realtime/message`. Red-Nose sends `invoke("SendToChannel", ingestChannel, "location", payload)`; the gateway POSTs, with a 5 s timeout:

```
POST /realtime/message
Content-Type: application/json

{ "channel": "wmsfo-api:ingest", "event": "location", "data": { ...payload }, "connectionId": "abc123", "identity": "5:2" }
```

Handling, in order:

1. The request carries any `X-Forwarded-*` header: `404`, empty body.
2. `channel` is not exactly `<WMSFO_SERVICE_NAME>:ingest`: `403 forbidden`. This is what stops a public-channel member from sending anything through `SendToChannel("<service>:location", ...)`; the gateway forwards such sends because the message path is set service-wide. This branch is the first check after step 1 and does no I/O; its only bound is the gateway's 10 messages per second per connection. A gateway feature that forwards `SendToChannel` only for channels joined with a credential is on the gateway backlog; it removes this path entirely when it lands.
3. Parse `identity` as `<beaconId>:<keyVersion>`. `identity` null or malformed, the beacon unknown, `revoked_at` set, or `key_version` different from the row: `403 forbidden`. Re-checked on every message so a revoked or rotated key stops at the next message, before the gateway's eviction sweep. Stamp `last_seen_at` only when the check passes.
4. `event === "location"`: validate and store `data` exactly as `POST /locations` (4.2), same fan-out. `200` with the `POST /locations` response body (`{ "seq", "published", "receivedAt", "serverTime" }`); `400 validation_failed`; `409 no_live_event`.
5. Any other `event` (including `heartbeat`): `400 validation_failed` (field `event`). Heartbeats travel over HTTP only (4.2).

Unknown fields in the callback body are ignored (0.2). The gateway ignores the response body and looks only at the status; a `2xx` resolves Red-Nose's invoke, and any non-2xx surfaces to Red-Nose as a thrown hub error with no detail, so the bodies in steps 4 and 5 never reach the phone. Red-Nose sends locations over the hub while its socket is up and over HTTP otherwise, and heartbeats over HTTP always (section 9). Rate: at most one location per second, inside the gateway's 10 per second per connection.

### 2.6 Events the API publishes

Every publish is `POST <WMSFO_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_URL>/internal/publish` with header `X-Gateway-Realtime-Token: <GATEWAY_REALTIME_TOKEN>` and body `{ "channel", "event", "payload" }`. Clients receive the envelope `{ channel, event, data }`: `payload` on the publish becomes `data` on the wire.

| Channel | `event` | `payload` | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<service>:location` | `location` | The live object (1.2), the same bytes as the CDN write that preceded it | After every live object write, by the node that wrote it (1.8) |

Nothing else is published. Publishes are best-effort: a `429`, a non-2xx, or a network failure is logged and not retried (the CDN write already happened, and the site's poll closes the gap). The publish budget is 50 per second per instance; the API's steady state during an event is about one per second.

### 2.7 Manifest entry

```json
{
  "image": "<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/wmsfo-api",
  "tag": "<sha>-prod",
  "port": 5000,
  "desiredStatus": "running",
  "envSecretRef": "<secret-name>",
  "includeInHealth": true,
  "realtimeAuthPath": "/realtime/authorize",
  "realtimeMessagePath": "/realtime/message",
  "realtimeAllowedOrigins": "https://<site-domain>",
  "realtimePresence": false
}
```

Dev (`wmsfo-api-dev`): `tag` is `<sha>-dev`; `realtimeAllowedOrigins` is `https://<preview-site-domain>,http://localhost:5173`. Only the site joins the hub, so only site origins are listed. `realtimePresence` stays false in both environments: presence events would expose beacon connection ids and identities to the public channel's audience. The manifest entry is created once from the dashboard, which also mints the publish token that the gateway injects as `GATEWAY_REALTIME_TOKEN`; CI never sends the realtime fields (the upsert is tri-state and preserves them) and only calls deploy (section 8.2).

---

## 3. Identity and credentials

### 3.1 Cognito

Two pools, `wmsfo-dev` and `wmsfo-prod`, each with two app clients, both public (no client secret), authorization code grant with PKCE, scopes `openid email profile` (the `wmsfo-admin` client additionally `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`, used by the panel's in-place TOTP enrolment). Username is the email address; Cognito verifies the email on sign-up; self sign-up is enabled (the site's sign-in link leads to the hosted UI, which offers sign-up). People and admins share the pool.

| Client | Used by | Callback URLs | Sign-out URLs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wmsfo-site` (`<site-client-id>`) | Public site | prod: `https://<site-domain>/auth/callback`; dev: `https://<preview-site-domain>/auth/callback`, `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback` | prod: `https://<site-domain>/`; dev: `https://<preview-site-domain>/`, `http://localhost:5173/` |
| `wmsfo-admin` (`<admin-client-id>`) | Admin panel | prod: `https://<admin-domain>/auth/callback`; dev: `https://<admin-dev-domain>/auth/callback`, `http://localhost:5174/auth/callback` | prod: `https://<admin-domain>/`; dev: `https://<admin-dev-domain>/`, `http://localhost:5174/` |

Token lifetimes: ID and access tokens 60 minutes; refresh token 30 days on `wmsfo-site`, 1 day on `wmsfo-admin`.

Pool MFA setting is optional with TOTP enabled and SMS disabled. Two groups: `admin` (name in `WMSFO_ADMIN_GROUP`, value `admin`) and `editor` (name in `WMSFO_EDITOR_GROUP`, value `editor`). Two authorization policies: `Editor` admits either group, `Admin` admits `admin` only; every `/admin/*` endpoint names one (4.5). The API enforces TOTP for both groups: on every `/admin/*` request it calls `AdminGetUser` for the token's `sub` (cached 5 minutes per user) and answers `403 mfa_required` unless `SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA` is enabled on the user. This needs `WMSFO_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` in the secret and `cognito-idp:AdminGetUser` on the instance role.

**Token used on every surface: the ID token.** The site and the admin panel send `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>` to the API. The API validates:

| Check | Value |
|---|---|
| Signature | JWKS at `https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<pool-id>/.well-known/jwks.json`, cached, refreshed on an unknown `kid` |
| `iss` | `WMSFO_COGNITO_ISSUER` = `https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<pool-id>` |
| `aud` | One of `WMSFO_COGNITO_CLIENT_IDS` |
| `token_use` | `"id"` |
| `exp` | Not expired, 60 s leeway |

Claims the API reads: `sub` (person identity, stored as `person.cognito_sub`), `email` (stored as `person.email`; used as the `created_by`, `changed_by`, `updated_by`, `hidden_by`, `uploaded_by` audit text), `cognito:groups` (array; `"admin"` present means admin, `"editor"` present means editor).

Person rows are upserted on every authenticated request:

```sql
insert into person (cognito_sub, email) values ($sub, $email)
on conflict (cognito_sub) do update set email = excluded.email, last_seen_at = now()
returning id;
```

Authorization: an `/admin/*` route under the `Admin` policy requires `cognito:groups` to contain `admin`; one under `Editor` requires `admin` or `editor`; otherwise `403 forbidden`.

Both frontends use `oidc-client-ts`:

```ts
const userManager = new UserManager({
  authority: COGNITO_AUTHORITY,          // https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<pool-id>
  client_id: CLIENT_ID,
  redirect_uri: `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`,
  response_type: "code",
  scope: "openid email profile",
  automaticSilentRenew: true,
});
```

The ID token is re-read from the user manager before every API call. Sign-out: Cognito's discovery document has no `end_session_endpoint`, so sign-out is `await userManager.removeUser()` followed by navigation to `${COGNITO_DOMAIN}/logout?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&logout_uri=${encodeURIComponent(SIGN_OUT_URL)}`, where `SIGN_OUT_URL` is the registered sign-out URL for the current origin. Hosted UI endpoints in use on `<cognito-domain>`: `/oauth2/authorize`, `/oauth2/token`, `/logout`.

The admin panel, after sign-in, checks `cognito:groups` on the ID token, shows only the views the caller's group allows, and shows a "this account has no role" page with a sign-out button when neither group is present. Red-Nose never uses Cognito.

### 3.2 Beacon keys

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Format | `wbk_` followed by 43 characters of unpadded URL-safe base64 (32 random bytes from a CSPRNG). 47 characters total. Regex `^wbk_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}$`. |
| Header | `X-Beacon-Key: <key>` on every beacon REST call. |
| Hub | The raw key is the second argument of `JoinPrivateChannel(ingestChannel, key)`. |
| At rest | `beacon.key_hash = sha256(key)` (32 bytes, unique index) plus `beacon.key_prefix` = the first 12 characters for display. Lookup is by hash; keys are never logged. |
| Shown | Once, in the create and rotate responses. Never retrievable afterwards. |
| Role | `beacon.role` is `beacon` or `admin`, chosen by the admin at creation, immutable. Both roles ingest identically; `admin` additionally unlocks Red-Nose's debug mode and `POST /beacons/logs`. |

### 3.3 Enrollment

Every key mint (create or rotate) also mints one enrollment token so the phone can fetch the same key by scanning a QR code.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Token format | `wet_` followed by 43 URL-safe base64 characters (32 random bytes). Regex `^wet_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}$`. |
| Lifetime | 15 minutes from mint. Single use. A phone enrolled later needs a rotate. |
| At rest | `beacon_enrollment_token.token_hash = sha256(token)`; `key_ciphertext` = AES-256-GCM of the plaintext key under `WMSFO_ENROLLMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (12-byte nonce prepended, 16-byte tag appended). On use the row gets `consumed_at` and `key_ciphertext` is nulled; pending rows are deleted on the beacon's next rotate or revoke; the nightly chore deletes rows expired or consumed more than 24 h ago. |
| QR payload | The enrollment URL as text: `rednose://enroll?api=<url-encoded api base url>&token=<token>`. Example: `rednose://enroll?api=https%3A%2F%2F<api-domain>&token=wet_...`. The API builds it from `WMSFO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`. |
| Rendering | The API returns the URL and a PNG rendering of it as a data URL (`qrPngDataUrl`) in the `Enrollment` object; the panel shows the PNG. |
| Exchange | `POST /beacons/enroll` (4.2). The response carries `beaconId`, `name`, `role`, `key`, `apiBaseUrl`, `hubUrl`, `ingestChannel`, `serverTime`. |
| Red-Nose handling | An intent filter on scheme `red-nose`, host `enroll`, so both the in-app scanner and the system camera land in the app. The app parses `api` and `token`, calls the exchange, and stores the fields in section 8.5 in Keystore-backed `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. |
| Manual path | The enrollment screen has fields for the API base URL (prefilled from the build flavour) and the key. Red-Nose verifies by calling `GET /beacons/me` and stores the same fields from that response. |

### 3.4 Revoke, rotate, activate, deactivate

- **Revoke** (`POST /admin/beacons/{id}/revoke`): sets `revoked_at`, clears `is_active`, deletes pending enrollment tokens. Effects: `X-Beacon-Key` calls answer `401 unauthenticated` immediately; hub joins are denied at the next callback; messages on an existing connection are rejected with `403` at the message path, so no update from a revoked key is stored; the gateway evicts the connection from the channel when its 15-minute allow lapses and the next sweep runs (up to about 16 minutes after the last join), and until then the message path's `403` is what stops it. Revocation is permanent; the row stays for history and export. Idempotent.
- **Rotate** (`POST /admin/beacons/{id}/rotate`): mints a new key and enrollment token, replaces `key_hash` and `key_prefix`, increments `key_version`, deletes pending tokens. The old key stops working immediately with the same effects as revoke for it: `X-Beacon-Key` calls with it answer `401`, joins with it are denied, and messages on a connection that joined with it carry the old `key_version` in `identity` and are rejected with `403` at the message path (2.5). `is_active` and `role` are unchanged. The response shows the new key once. `409 beacon_revoked` on a revoked beacon.
- **Activate** (`POST /admin/beacons/{id}/activate`): clears `is_active` on every other row, then sets this beacon's `is_active = true`, in that order in one transaction (the partial unique index is checked per statement). `409 beacon_revoked` on a revoked beacon. Takes effect on the next stored update (the location transaction reads `is_active`, 7.2).
- **Deactivate** (`POST /admin/beacons/{id}/deactivate`): clears `is_active`. Zero active beacons means nothing fans out until another is activated. Idempotent.

### 3.5 Protecting the callback endpoints

`/realtime/authorize` and `/realtime/message` are ordinary routes on the container port, so the public proxy would forward `https://<api-domain>/realtime/message` to them. The gateway's own callback client attaches no credential. Proxied requests always carry `X-Forwarded-For` (added by the load balancer and by the proxy); the gateway's direct callbacks never do. The API therefore answers `404` with an empty body to any request on these two paths that carries `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, or `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and processes the rest. Before the event an operator confirms whether the gateway already refuses these two paths on its public listener; a gateway feature that attaches `X-Gateway-Realtime-Token` on its callbacks is on the gateway backlog, and when it lands the API switches to comparing that header.

---

## 4. REST API

### 4.0 Common

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Content type | Requests with a body send `Content-Type: application/json` unless marked multipart or text. Responses are `application/json; charset=utf-8`. |
| Body limits | 64 KB for JSON, 256 KB for section, item, and site settings bodies, 5 MB for route uploads, 2 MB for beacon logs, 8 KB for heartbeats. Media bytes never pass through the API (presigned upload, 4.5 Media): 20 MB for raster and GIF, 1 MB for SVG, checked at confirm. Over the limit: `413 payload_too_large`. |
| Auth headers | `X-Beacon-Key` (beacon), `Authorization: Bearer <id-token>` (person, admin). A request that carries both is `400 validation_failed`. |
| Common errors | `400 validation_failed`, `401 unauthenticated`, `403 forbidden`, `404 not_found`, `405` (no body), `413 payload_too_large`, `415 unsupported_media_type`, `429 rate_limited`, `500 internal_error`, `502 upstream_failed`. Listed per endpoint only when the endpoint adds a code. |
| CORS | The API answers CORS for the exact origins in `WMSFO_CORS_ORIGINS`: methods `GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE`, headers `Authorization, Content-Type, X-Beacon-Key, X-App-Version`, `Access-Control-Max-Age: 600`, no credentials. Red-Nose is not a browser and needs none. |
| Client IP | Taken from `X-Forwarded-For` counting `WMSFO_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` (default 2: the load balancer and the gateway proxy) entries from the right. Used for rate limiting and contact-message records only. |
| `serverTime` | Every `2xx` response to a beacon endpoint carries `serverTime` (rfc3339), stamped when the response body is serialized, after any transaction has committed. Red-Nose uses it for clock skew (section 9). |
| Rate limits | Token buckets, per node (not fleet-wide), keyed as shown. Over budget: `429` with `Retry-After` and `details.retryAfterSeconds`. The callback paths and `/api/health` are exempt. |

| Endpoint | Key | Rate | Burst |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /locations` | beacon id | 10/s | 20 |
| `POST /beacons/heartbeat` | beacon id | 1/s | 5 |
| `POST /beacons/logs` | beacon id | 1/min | 2 |
| `POST /beacons/enroll` | client IP | 10/min | 10 |
| `GET /beacons/me` | beacon id | 1/s | 5 |
| `POST /contact` | client IP | 5/hour | 5 |
| `POST /subscriptions/verify`, `POST /subscriptions/unsubscribe` | client IP | 30/min | 30 |
| `POST /cookies` | person id | 1/s | 3 |
| `POST /me/subscriptions`, `.../resend-verification` | person id | 5/hour | 5 |
| `GET /preview/document` | client IP | 60/min | 60 |
| `POST /admin/media/upload-url` | person id | 30/min | 30 |
| `/admin/*` | person id | 20/s | 40 |

Shared resource shapes (all camelCase, all timestamps rfc3339). Column-to-wire mapping is mechanical snake_case to camelCase; the only non-mechanical names are `contact_message.body` (request field `message`), `beacon.key_prefix` (`keyPrefix`), and `media_asset.s3_key` and `variants` (exposed as absolute CDN URLs `url` and `variants`).

List endpoints that page use `?limit=` (default 50, max 500) and `?cursor=` (opaque, from `nextCursor`). Lists without `nextCursor` in their response are unpaged.

### 4.1 Health

**`GET /api/health`**. No auth. The gateway's health prober and its blue-green candidate check issue `GET {base}/api/health`; this is why the path carries the `/api` prefix. `200 { "status": "ok" }` when migrations have completed, the node's cache has loaded, and `select 1` answers within 2 s; otherwise `503` with the error shape and `code: "unavailable"`. No other data, `Cache-Control: no-store`. Reachable through the proxy. A node still applying migrations under the advisory lock answers `503`. During a blue-green replacement the gateway keeps the old container serving until the new one answers `200`; on a first create there is no old container and requests reaching the node answer `503` until migrations finish (clients retry).

### 4.2 Beacon endpoints

**`POST /beacons/enroll`**. No auth header; the token is the credential.

```json
{ "token": "wet_..." }
```

`200`:

```json
{
  "beaconId": 5, "name": "Helicopter phone", "role": "beacon",
  "key": "wbk_...", "apiBaseUrl": "https://<api-domain>", "hubUrl": "wss://<gateway-domain>/hub",
  "ingestChannel": "wmsfo-api:ingest",
  "serverTime": "2026-12-01T18:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Errors: `400 validation_failed` (format), `404 enrollment_token_invalid` (unknown, used, expired, or the beacon is revoked). Idempotency: none; the token is consumed on the first success in the same transaction. Not retryable after success.

**`GET /beacons/me`**. `X-Beacon-Key`. `200 { "beaconId", "name", "role", "isActive", "apiBaseUrl", "hubUrl", "ingestChannel", "liveEventId", "serverTime" }` (`liveEventId` is `int64 | null`). Stamps `last_seen_at`. Errors: `401 unauthenticated` (unknown or revoked key).

**`POST /locations`**. `X-Beacon-Key`.

```json
{ "lat": 46.87, "lng": -114.0, "recordedAt": "2026-12-22T01:31:07Z",
  "speedMps": 31.2, "altitudeM": 1210, "headingDeg": 84, "accuracyM": 6 }
```

| Field | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `lat` | `number` | required, -90 to 90 |
| `lng` | `number` | required, -180 to 180 |
| `recordedAt` | `rfc3339` | required, parseable; no plausibility check |
| `speedMps` | `number \| null` | optional, 0 to 500 |
| `altitudeM` | `number \| null` | optional, -500 to 20000 |
| `headingDeg` | `number \| null` | optional, 0 to 360 |
| `accuracyM` | `number \| null` | optional, 0 to 100000 |

Handling: resolve the beacon (`401` if unknown or revoked); run the location transaction (7.2): lock the live event row (none: `409 no_live_event`, nothing stored), `seq = event.next_seq`, insert with `published = beacon.is_active` read in the same transaction, stamp `last_seen_at` and `last_location_at`, read the `snapshot` row, commit. Respond. Then, if `published`, update memory and write the live object (1.8).

`201`:

```json
{ "seq": 1832, "published": true, "receivedAt": "...", "serverTime": "..." }
```

Errors: `400 validation_failed`, `401 unauthenticated`, `409 no_live_event`, `429 rate_limited`. Idempotency: none. A retry after a lost response creates a second row with a higher `seq`; harmless.

**`POST /beacons/heartbeat`**. `X-Beacon-Key`. HTTP only, every 15 s, whether or not the socket is up; its answer is the only source of `liveEventId`, `isActive`, and the clock skew on the phone.

```json
{
  "sentAt": "2026-12-22T01:31:07.000Z",
  "power":     { "batteryPercent": 87, "charging": true, "batteryTempC": 31.5, "thermalStatus": "none" },
  "radio":     { "networkType": "LTE", "signalDbm": -95, "signalLevel": 3, "airplaneMode": false, "connected": true },
  "gps":       { "provider": "fused", "satellitesUsed": 9, "satellitesInView": 14, "lastFixAccuracyM": 6,
                 "lastFixAgeS": 1, "fixesLastMinute": 58,
                 "permission": { "foreground": true, "background": true, "precise": true } },
  "transport": { "socketState": "connected", "reconnectCount": 2, "httpFallbackSeconds": 0,
                 "lastReceiptLatencyMs": 120, "sendsFailedSinceBoot": 3 },
  "process":   { "deviceUptimeS": 90000, "serviceUptimeS": 3000, "serviceRestartCount": 1, "memoryPressure": "normal",
                 "batteryOptimizationExempt": true, "notificationPermission": true, "systemApp": true, "rootAvailable": true },
  "identity":  { "deviceModel": "Pixel 6a", "androidVersion": "14", "appVersion": "1.0.3", "clockSkewMs": -120 }
}
```

Validation: top-level keys must be exactly these seven (`sentAt` required rfc3339; the six groups each an object or `null`); every leaf is nullable; numbers finite; strings 64 characters max; `thermalStatus`, `memoryPressure`, `socketState` from the lookups in 0.5 when non-null; whole body 8 KB max. Nested keys not listed here are tolerated and stored as received (the phone is sideloaded on its own schedule; new telemetry leaves never break heartbeats). Handling: stamp `last_heartbeat_at = now()`, `last_seen_at`, `telemetry = body`; clear `stale_since`. Both a heartbeat and a stored location (7.2) clear `stale_since`. Never touches the live object or the site.

`200 { "receivedAt": "...", "liveEventId": 7, "isActive": true, "serverTime": "..." }` (`liveEventId` is `int64 | null`; `isActive` is the row's flag; Red-Nose shows both on its status screen, section 9.3). Errors: `400`, `401`, `429`.

**`POST /beacons/logs`**. `X-Beacon-Key` with role `admin`; `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`; body up to 2 MB; optional header `X-App-Version` (64 characters max). Stored in `beacon_log`. `201 { "id": 17, "sizeBytes": 183422, "receivedAt": "...", "serverTime": "..." }`. Errors: `401`, `403 forbidden` (role `beacon`), `413`, `415`, `429`.

### 4.3 Public endpoints (no auth)

**`POST /contact`**.

```json
{ "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com", "message": "Hello" }
```

Rules: `name` 1 to 100, `email` a valid address 3 to 254, `message` 1 to 2000. Stores `contact_message` (with the client IP) and writes outbox row `contact.received`; the leader chore emails it to `WMSFO_CONTACT_NOTIFY_EMAIL`. The request never waits on SES. `201 { "id": 12, "createdAt": "..." }`. Errors: `400`, `429`. Idempotency: none.

**`POST /subscriptions/verify`**. Body `{ "token": "wsv_..." }`. Called by the site page `/alerts/verify`, which reads `token` from its query string (the email link is a site link, never an API link, so a mail scanner following it changes nothing). Looks the row up by `sha256(token)`. Row already verified: `200 { "verifiedAt": "..." }` with the existing `verifiedAt`, regardless of `verify_expires_at`. Row unverified and unexpired: sets `verified_at`, `200 { "verifiedAt": "..." }`. Row unverified and expired, or no row: `404 not_found`. The hash stays on the row until the next mint or the row is deleted.

**`POST /subscriptions/unsubscribe`**. The token comes from either place: the query string `?token=wsu_...` or a JSON body `{ "token": "wsu_..." }`. The query form exists for RFC 8058: the `List-Unsubscribe` header names `https://<api-domain>/subscriptions/unsubscribe?token=wsu_...` and mail clients POST the form body `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` to it; the API accepts `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` there and ignores the form body. The site page `/alerts/unsubscribe` reads `token` from its query string and sends the JSON form. Sets `unsubscribed_at`. `204`. Idempotent. Unknown token: `404 not_found`.

**`GET /preview/document?token=wpv_...`**. The one public read, used only by the site's `/preview` route inside the admin panel's preview frame (4.5 Content). Answers `200 ContentBundle`: the working set as it would publish (hidden rows omitted), the media map for it, and the icon map, with `Cache-Control: no-store`. Unknown or expired token: `404 preview_token_invalid`. Rate limited per client IP (4.0).

### 4.4 Registered person endpoints (`Authorization: Bearer <id-token>`)

**`GET /me`**. `200 { "person": Person, "isAdmin": false }`.

**`GET /me/subscriptions`**. `200 { "items": Subscription[] }`.

**`POST /me/subscriptions`**. `{ "channel": "email", "address": "jane@example.com" }`. `address` is trimmed and lowercased before validation, storage, and every comparison. Creates the subscriber row for this person (or re-activates it for this person when the address exists unsubscribed and belongs to this person: clears `unsubscribed_at`, keeps `verified_at`). When the row is not verified: mints a `wsv_` verify token (hashed at rest, 24 h) and writes outbox `subscription.verify` carrying the plaintext token (7.7); `201 Subscription` with `verifiedAt` null. When re-activating a verified row: no token, no outbox row; `201 Subscription` with the existing `verifiedAt`. Errors: `400 validation_failed` (`channel` not `email`, bad address), `409 address_taken` (address belongs to another person), `409 already_subscribed` (verified and not unsubscribed for this person). A re-POST for the same person and address in pending state returns `200` with the existing row and sends nothing. Verification is required even when the address equals the Cognito email.

**`POST /me/subscriptions/{id}/resend-verification`**. Mints a fresh verify token and writes outbox `subscription.verify` carrying the plaintext token (7.7). `202 Subscription`. Errors: `404`, `409 already_verified`.

**`DELETE /me/subscriptions/{id}`**. Sets `unsubscribed_at`. `204`. Errors: `404`. Idempotent.

**`GET /me/cookies`**. Cookies this person left on the current event.

```json
{ "eventId": 7, "eventStatusId": 3, "limit": 10, "used": 3, "remaining": 7,
  "items": [ { "id": 90, "cookieTypeId": 3, "note": "yum", "leftAt": "...", "hiddenAt": null } ] }
```

`eventId` and `eventStatusId` null and `items` empty when no event is current. `limit` is the current `cookie_limit_per_person`; `used` counts hidden cookies too; `remaining` is `max(0, limit - used)`, an `int`.

**`POST /cookies`**. `{ "cookieTypeId": 3, "note": "yum" }`. `note` optional, 0 to 140 characters, `null` when absent. Transaction: `select ... for update` on the person row (serializes this person's inserts); load the live event (`status_id = 3`) else `409 no_live_event`; the cookie type must exist and be active else `404 not_found`; count this person's cookies on the event (hidden or not) and compare with `cookie_limit_per_person` read inside the transaction else `409 cookie_limit_reached`; insert; commit; increment this node's tally counter. `201 { "id": 90, "eventId": 7, "cookieTypeId": 3, "note": "yum", "leftAt": "...", "remaining": 6 }` (`remaining` is `max(0, limit - used)` after the insert, an `int`). Idempotency: none; each accepted call is one cookie. Hidden cookies leave the tally but still count toward the limit; deleted cookies do not.

### 4.5 Admin endpoints (`Authorization: Bearer <id-token>` with group `admin` or `editor`)

Each group of endpoints names its policy (3.1): **Editor** admits both groups, **Admin** admits `admin` only. Editor endpoints: Sponsors, Pages, Sections and items, Site settings, Content, Media, Icons. Everything else is Admin. All admin writes record the caller's `email` claim in the audit column named per table. Writes marked **[snapshot]** run the transaction in 7.3 and answer `502 snapshot_write_failed` if the snapshot upload fails; after commit the node writes the live object (1.8). The response is sent immediately after commit. The live-object write and publish run after the response and never delay it; their outcome is visible only through `GET /admin/live`.

#### Events (Admin)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Endpoint-specific errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/events` | | `200 { "items": Event[] }` ordered `year` desc | |
| `POST /admin/events` **[snapshot]** | `{ "year": 2026, "name": "...", "scheduledAt": null, "fundsPercent": 0, "routeId": null, "inheritRoute": true }` (`year`, `name`, `inheritRoute` required; `scheduledAt` defaults null; `fundsPercent` defaults 0; `routeId` defaults null; `year` 2000 to 2100 unique; `name` 1 to 200; `fundsPercent` 0 to 100) | `201 Event` with `statusId` 1, `isCurrent` false. `inheritRoute: true` requires `routeId` null (`400` otherwise) and copies the `route_id` of the event with the greatest `year` that has one (none: no route); `inheritRoute: false` uses `routeId` as given. | `400`, `404 not_found` (routeId), `409 year_taken` |
| `GET /admin/events/{id}` | | `200 Event` | |
| `PATCH /admin/events/{id}` **[snapshot]** | Any of `name`, `year`, `scheduledAt`, `wentLiveAt`, `endedAt`, `fundsPercent`, `routeId` | `200 Event` | `404` (event or route), `409 year_taken`, `409 scheduled_at_required` (`scheduledAt: null` while `statusId` is 2) |
| `DELETE /admin/events/{id}` **[snapshot]** | | `204`; cascades messages, cookies, status history; clears `is_current` | `409 event_live` (status 3), `409 event_has_locations` (any `location` row) |
| `POST /admin/events/{id}/current` **[snapshot]** | none | `200 Event` (`isCurrent` true; the previous current event's flag cleared in the same transaction). Idempotent: on the already-current event, `200 Event` with no snapshot rebuild and no live-object write, in every status. | `409 current_event_live` (another event is current and live) |
| `POST /admin/events/{id}/status` **[snapshot]** | `{ "statusId": 3, "notify": true }` (both required) | `200 Event` | `400` (unknown status), `409 event_status_unchanged` (same status), `409 event_not_current` (3 requested and `isCurrent` false), `409 another_event_live` (3 requested while another event has status 3), `409 scheduled_at_required` (2 requested and `scheduledAt` null) |
| `GET /admin/events/{id}/status-history` | | `200 { "items": StatusHistory[] }` newest first | |
| `GET /admin/events/{id}/messages` | | `200 { "items": EventMessage[] }` newest first | |
| `POST /admin/events/{id}/messages` **[snapshot]** | `{ "body": "...", "eventTime": null, "notify": true }` (`body` 1 to 1000; `notify` required) | `201 EventMessage`; writes outbox `event.message_posted` only when `notify` is true | |
| `PATCH /admin/events/{id}/messages/{messageId}` **[snapshot]** | `body`, `eventTime` | `200 EventMessage` (no outbox row) | `404` |
| `DELETE /admin/events/{id}/messages/{messageId}` **[snapshot]** | | `204` | `404` |
| `GET /admin/events/{id}/locations?cursor=&limit=&beaconId=&publishedOnly=false` | | `200 Page<LocationRow>` ordered `seq` asc; with `Accept: text/csv` streams every matching row (paging ignored) with the header `seq,beaconId,published,recordedAt,receivedAt,lat,lng,speedMps,altitudeM,headingDeg,accuracyM` | |
| `GET /admin/events/{id}/cookies?cursor=&limit=&includeHidden=true` | | `200 Page<CookieAdmin>` newest first | |

Status change transaction: lock the event row; check the rules above; update `status_id`; stamp `went_live_at = now()` on every entry into 3 and `ended_at = now()` on every entry into 4 (earlier stamps are overwritten; the admin can correct either with `PATCH`); on every entry into 4 also set `final_cookie_tally` to the current non-hidden counts (`jsonb_object_agg` per type) and on every exit from 4 set it to null; insert `event_status_history`; insert outbox `event.status_changed { eventId, fromStatusId, toStatusId, notify }`; rebuild the snapshot; commit. After commit the node writes the live object with the new `eventStatusId` and `snapshotUrl` and publishes it. Any status may follow any other status; the admin decides, and `notify` decides whether subscribers are emailed (only entries into 2 and 3 produce emails, section 7.7).

#### Routes (Admin)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/routes` | | `200 { "items": Route[] }` newest first | |
| `GET /admin/routes/{id}` | | `200 Route` | |
| `POST /admin/routes` | `{ "name": "2026 draft", "points": [ { "lat", "lng", "recordedAt" } ] }` per 1.4 | `201 Route`. Canonicalizes and hashes (1.6), looks `route` up by `s3_key` before the PUT (when a row exists: `200` that row and nothing is written), PUTs `routes/{sha256}.json`, inserts the row. When the insert after the PUT fails on `s3_key unique` (concurrent identical upload): `200` the existing row. | `400`, `413`, `502 route_write_failed` |
| `POST /admin/routes/from-event/{eventId}` | `{ "name": "2026 flight" }` (`name` 1 to 200) | `201 Route` built from the event's `published = true` locations in `seq` order (`lat`, `lng`, `recordedAt = recorded_at`), then stored exactly like an upload (canonicalize, hash, existing-row check, PUT, insert). Point count must be 2 to 50,000. | `404` (event), `400 validation_failed` (fewer than 2 points), `413` (over 50,000), `502 route_write_failed` |
| `DELETE /admin/routes/{id}` | | `204`; deletes the object | `409 route_in_use` (an event references it) |

Attaching a route to an event is `PATCH /admin/events/{id}` with `routeId`.

#### Beacons (Admin)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/beacons` | | `200 { "items": Beacon[], "staleAfterS": 45 }` by name (telemetry included; `staleAfterS` is the current `beacon_stale_after_s`; `hubConnected` is true when the gateway's presence list for `<service>:ingest` contains an identity `<id>:<keyVersion>` for the beacon, false when it does not, null when the presence call failed) | |
| `GET /admin/beacons/{id}` | | `200 Beacon` (`hubConnected` resolved the same way) | |
| `POST /admin/beacons` | `{ "name": "...", "notes": "", "role": "beacon" }` (`name` 1 to 100, `notes` 0 to 2000) | `201 { "beacon": Beacon, "key": "wbk_...", "enrollment": Enrollment }` | `400` |
| `PATCH /admin/beacons/{id}` | `name`, `notes` | `200 Beacon` | `404` |
| `POST /admin/beacons/{id}/activate` | none | `200 Beacon` | `409 beacon_revoked` |
| `POST /admin/beacons/{id}/deactivate` | none | `200 Beacon` | |
| `POST /admin/beacons/{id}/rotate` | none | `200 { "beacon": Beacon, "key": "wbk_...", "enrollment": Enrollment }` | `409 beacon_revoked` |
| `POST /admin/beacons/{id}/revoke` | none | `200 Beacon` | |
| `GET /admin/beacons/{id}/logs` | | `200 { "items": BeaconLog[] }` newest first | |
| `GET /admin/beacons/{id}/logs/{logId}` | | `200 text/plain` body | `404` |

#### Sponsors (Editor)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/sponsors` | | `200 { "items": Sponsor[] }` by name | |
| `GET /admin/sponsors/{id}` | | `200 Sponsor` | |
| `POST /admin/sponsors` **[snapshot]** | `name` (1 to 200) plus any of `contactPerson`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `websiteUrl`, `fbUrl`, `igUrl` (URLs absolute http or https, 2048 max) | `201 Sponsor` | |
| `PATCH /admin/sponsors/{id}` **[snapshot]** | same fields plus `logoMediaId` (a ready media asset id, or null to clear) | `200 Sponsor` | `404` (sponsor or media), `409 media_not_ready` |
| `DELETE /admin/sponsors/{id}` **[snapshot]** | | `204`; deletes years and the row; the logo asset stays in the library | `404` |
| `PUT /admin/sponsors/{id}/years/{eventYear}` **[snapshot]** | `{ "amountDonated": 500.00, "active": true, "canAdvertise": true, "anonymous": false }` (`amountDonated` 0 to 1,000,000,000 with at most 2 decimals, or null; the three booleans required; `eventYear` 2000 to 2100) | `200 Sponsor` (upsert on `(sponsor_id, event_year)`, idempotent) | `404` |
| `DELETE /admin/sponsors/{id}/years/{eventYear}` **[snapshot]** | | `204` (idempotent) | `404` (sponsor) |

A logo is any media asset (raster, gif, or svg) uploaded through the Media endpoints and chosen on the sponsor; there is no separate logo upload.

#### Cookie types (Admin)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/cookie-types` | | `200 { "items": CookieType[] }` by `sort`, `id` | |
| `POST /admin/cookie-types` **[snapshot]** | `{ "name": "...", "sort": 10, "active": true, "icon": null }` (`name` 1 to 100; `sort` -1000 to 1000; `icon` an `Icon` or null; all four required) | `201 CookieType` | `409 event_live`, `404` (media icon), `409 media_not_ready`, `400` (media icon not svg, unknown library id) |
| `PATCH /admin/cookie-types/{id}` **[snapshot]** | subset of `name`, `sort`, `active`, `icon` | `200 CookieType` | `404`, `409 event_live`, `409 media_not_ready`, `400` |

Every write in this group returns `409 event_live` while any event has `status_id = 3`. There is no delete; `active: false` removes a type from the snapshot. Artwork is an icon: a library id or an uploaded SVG media asset.

#### Pages (Editor)

Pages, sections, items, and the site settings draft are the working set. Writes here validate at the draft level (1.3a), never rebuild the snapshot, and reach the site only through a publish. `slug` matches `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, 1 to 60 characters, and is not one of `auth`, `preview`, `api`, `admin`, `assets`.

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/pages` | | `200 { "items": PageAdmin[] }` ordered `role` pages first (in status order, `no_event` first), then `none` pages by `navPosition`, `id` | |
| `POST /admin/pages` | `{ "slug": "about", "title": "About", "navLabel": "About", "navPosition": 10, "isHidden": false }` (`slug`, `title` required; `title` 1 to 200; `navLabel` null or 1 to 40; `navPosition` defaults to one past the greatest; role is always `none`) | `201 PageAdmin` | `400 slug_reserved`, `409 slug_taken` |
| `GET /admin/pages/{id}` | | `200 PageDetail` (sections with items in order, each with its publish-level `problems`) | `404` |
| `PATCH /admin/pages/{id}` | subset of `slug`, `title`, `navLabel`, `navPosition`, `isHidden` | `200 PageAdmin`. On a role page `navLabel` must stay null and `isHidden` false (`400`). | `404`, `400 slug_reserved`, `409 slug_taken` |
| `DELETE /admin/pages/{id}` | | `204`; cascades sections and items | `404`, `409 page_has_role` |
| `PUT /admin/pages/order` | `{ "ids": [3, 5, 4] }` (every `none` page exactly once) | `200 { "items": PageAdmin[] }`; `navPosition` becomes the index times 10 | `400` |

The six role pages are created by the seed (sql.md 6) with slugs `no-event`, `planned`, `scheduled`, `live`, `ended`, `cancelled`; their role never changes and they cannot be deleted. Reaching `/<slug>` of a role page on the site redirects to `/`.

#### Sections and items (Editor)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/content/kinds` | | `200 { "items": KindInfo[] }` in palette order; `schema` and `itemSchema` are the publish-level JSON Schemas with the primitives inlined under `$defs`; `defaults` is a draft-valid starting `data` | |
| `POST /admin/pages/{id}/sections` | `{ "kind": "rich_text", "position": 2, "data": {...}, "presentation": {...} }` (`kind` required; `position` defaults to the end; `data` defaults to the kind's `defaults`; `presentation` defaults to `{ width: "wide", align: "start", background: { kind: "none" }, spacing: "normal", iconBefore: null, iconAfter: null, anchor: null }`) | `201 SectionAdmin`; later sections shift down | `404`, `400 unknown_kind`, `409 kind_not_allowed` (`allowedRoles` excludes the page's role) |
| `PATCH /admin/sections/{id}` | subset of `data`, `presentation`, `isHidden` (`kind` is immutable) | `200 SectionAdmin` | `404`, `400 validation_failed` (draft level) |
| `DELETE /admin/sections/{id}` | | `204`; items cascade; later sections close the gap | `404` |
| `POST /admin/sections/{id}/duplicate` | none | `201 SectionAdmin`: a copy with its items directly after the source | `404` |
| `POST /admin/sections/{id}/move` | `{ "pageId": 4, "position": 0 }` | `200 SectionAdmin` | `404`, `409 kind_not_allowed` |
| `PUT /admin/pages/{id}/sections/order` | `{ "ids": [...] }` (every section of the page exactly once) | `200 PageDetail` | `400`, `404` |
| `POST /admin/sections/{id}/items` | `{ "data": {...}, "position": 0 }` | `201 SectionItemAdmin` | `404`, `400` (kind has no items, or draft validation) |
| `PATCH /admin/items/{id}` | subset of `data`, `isHidden` | `200 SectionItemAdmin` | `404`, `400` |
| `DELETE /admin/items/{id}` | | `204` | `404` |
| `PUT /admin/sections/{id}/items/order` | `{ "ids": [...] }` | `200 SectionAdmin` | `400`, `404` |

`position` values are compacted to 0, 1, 2, ... after every write that changes order.

#### Site settings (Editor)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/site-settings` | | `200 SiteSettingsDraft` | |
| `PUT /admin/site-settings` | `{ "data": Partial<SiteSettings> }` (whole document, draft level) | `200 SiteSettingsDraft` | `400` |

#### Content: status, publish, versions, preview (Editor)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/content/status` | | `200 ContentStatus`: the newest version, the working set's hash, whether they differ, and every publish-level problem in the working set | |
| `GET /admin/content/draft` | | `200 ContentBundle` for the working set (what a publish would produce) | |
| `POST /admin/content/publish` **[snapshot]** | `{ "label": "December copy" }` (`label` null or 1 to 100) | `201 ContentVersionInfo`. Builds the document from the working set (hidden rows omitted, 1.3a order), validates at the publish level, inserts `content_version` with the referenced media ids, deletes versions beyond the newest 50, rebuilds the snapshot, commits, writes the live object. | `422 content_invalid` (`details.problems: ProblemRef[]`), `409 content_unchanged` (hash equals the newest version's), `502 snapshot_write_failed` |
| `GET /admin/content/versions` | | `200 { "items": ContentVersionInfo[] }` newest first | |
| `GET /admin/content/versions/{id}` | | `200 ContentVersionInfo & { "document": ContentDocument }` | `404` |
| `POST /admin/content/versions/{id}/restore` | none | `200 ContentStatus`. Replaces the working set (pages, sections, items, site settings draft) with the version's document; rows get new ids; role pages keep their roles. Nothing is published. | `404` |
| `POST /admin/content/preview-token` | none | `201 PreviewToken`: `token` is `wpv_` plus 43 base64url characters, hashed at rest, valid 15 minutes, reusable until expiry; `url` is `<site-base-url>/preview?token=<token>` | |

Preview: the panel loads `url` plus `&page=<slug>` in an iframe; the site's `/preview` route fetches `GET /preview/document?token=` (4.3), substitutes the bundle for `snapshot.content`, `media`, and `icons`, and renders the named page (a role page by its slug, whatever the current status) with the real live object and snapshot for the live sections. Changing a section in the panel and reloading the frame shows the change; nothing is published.

#### Media (Editor)

The pipeline is presign, upload, confirm. Media bytes never pass through the API.

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/media?cursor=&limit=&kind=&state=&q=` | | `200 Page<MediaAsset>` newest first; `kind` and `state` optional filters; `q` matches `filename`, `title`, `alt` case-insensitively | |
| `POST /admin/media/upload-url` | `{ "filename": "hangar.jpg", "contentType": "image/jpeg", "sizeBytes": 1834211, "alt": "", "title": "" }` (`contentType` one of `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`, `image/svg+xml`; `sizeBytes` 1 to the limit for the type; `filename` 1 to 100 after sanitizing; `alt` 0 to 500; `title` 0 to 200) | `201 UploadTicket`: a `pending` row, key `media/{id}/{filename}`, and a presigned `PUT` (15 minutes) whose signed headers are `Content-Type` and `x-amz-tagging: state=pending`; the panel must send exactly `headers` | `400`, `413` (over the type's limit) |
| `POST /admin/media/{id}/confirm` | none | `200 MediaAsset` with `state: "ready"`. The API reads the object, checks the size against the ticket and the limit, sniffs the type (must match `contentType`), validates SVG (below), decodes raster with a 40-megapixel ceiling, records `width`, `height`, `sha256`, derives `w480`, `w960`, `w1600` WebP variants for raster narrower widths than the source (never for gif or svg), PUTs them, removes the pending tag, and updates the row. | `404` (row), `404 upload_not_found` (object missing), `409 media_not_pending`, `413`, `400 validation_failed` (sniff mismatch, SVG rules, decode failure; the object is deleted and the row removed) |
| `GET /admin/media/{id}` | | `200 MediaAsset` | `404` |
| `GET /admin/media/{id}/usage` | | `200 MediaUsage` | `404` |
| `PATCH /admin/media/{id}` **[snapshot]** | subset of `alt`, `title` | `200 MediaAsset` | `404` |
| `DELETE /admin/media/{id}` | | `204`; deletes every object under `media/{id}/` and the row, in any state | `404`, `409 media_in_use` (`details.usage: MediaUsage`) |

A ticket whose object never arrives expires by the bucket's lifecycle rule (tag `state=pending`, 1 day) and its row by the nightly cleanup (7.6). In use means referenced by the working set, by any retained version, by a sponsor, by a cookie type, or by the site settings draft.

SVG validation (library icons, uploaded SVG): the document is parsed without DTDs or external resolution and rejected with `400 validation_failed` on field `file` when the root element is not `svg`, or it contains a `script` or `foreignObject` element, any attribute whose name starts with `on`, or an `href` or `xlink:href` whose value starts with `http:`, `https:`, or `javascript:`. The stored bytes are the uploaded bytes.

Orphan collection (leader chore, 7.6): a ready asset referenced nowhere gets `unreferencedSince`; after 30 days it is tagged `state=orphaned` on every object and marked `orphaned`; the lifecycle rule deletes the objects 7 days later and the chore deletes the row after 8. A reference appearing again during those 7 days removes the tag and returns the asset to `ready`. An orphaned asset is listed by `GET /admin/media?state=orphaned` so an editor can see what is about to go.

#### Icons (Editor)

| Method and path | Success |
|---|---|
| `GET /admin/icons` | `200 { "items": IconInfo[] }`: the built-in library, ordered by `name`; `url` is the CDN URL the snapshot carries |

Uploaded icons are media assets of kind `svg` (`GET /admin/media?kind=svg`); the panel's icon picker shows both.

#### Cookies (moderation, Admin)

| Method and path | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /admin/cookies/{id}/hide` | `200 CookieAdmin` (`hiddenAt`, `hiddenBy` set; excluded from the tally) | `404` |
| `POST /admin/cookies/{id}/unhide` | `200 CookieAdmin` | `404` |
| `DELETE /admin/cookies/{id}` | `204` (hard delete) | `404` |

Allowed in any event status. While the event has status 3, each re-reads the tally from SQL after commit and writes the live object (1.8); in any other status the write changes SQL only, no live object is written, and once the event has ended the public numbers are the frozen `final_cookie_tally`. No snapshot rebuild.

#### Settings (Admin)

| Method and path | Body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/settings` | | `200 { "items": Setting[] }` (every key in section 6; defaults filled in for keys without a row, with `updatedBy` and `updatedAt` null) | |
| `PUT /admin/settings/{key}` **[snapshot]** | `{ "value": 5000 }` | `200 Setting` | `404` (unknown key), `400 validation_failed` (type or range) |

#### Contact messages, subscribers, people (Admin)

| Method and path | Success |
|---|---|
| `GET /admin/contact-messages?cursor=&limit=` | `200 Page<ContactMessage>` newest first |
| `DELETE /admin/contact-messages/{id}` | `204` |
| `GET /admin/subscribers?cursor=&limit=&status=verified\|pending\|unsubscribed` | `200 Page<SubscriberAdmin>` newest first (`status` optional) |
| `GET /admin/subscribers/summary` | `200 { "verified": 812, "pending": 40, "unsubscribed": 12 }` |
| `DELETE /admin/subscribers/{id}` | `204` (hard delete; the person may subscribe again) |
| `GET /admin/people?cursor=&limit=` | `200 Page<Person & { cookieCount: number }>` (`cookieCount` over all events) |
| `DELETE /admin/people/{id}` | `204`; deletes the person's subscriber rows and cookies, then the row; the Cognito user is removed separately in the console |

Contact messages and cookie notes have no automatic retention; they stay until an admin deletes them.

#### Snapshot and live diagnostics (Admin)

| Method and path | Success |
|---|---|
| `GET /admin/snapshot` | `200 SnapshotInfo` |
| `POST /admin/snapshot/rebuild` **[snapshot]** | `200 SnapshotInfo` (rebuilds from the database even when nothing changed; version increments even when the content hash is unchanged) |
| `GET /admin/live` | `200 { "lastWriteAt": rfc3339 or null, "lastWriteSeq": int64 or null, "lastWriteVersion": int64 or null, "lastWriteError": string or null, "lastWriteNode": string or null, "node": { "instance": "<gateway instanceId or null>", "isLeader": bool, "leaderEvaluatedAt": rfc3339 or null, "cacheRefreshedAt": rfc3339, "live": LiveObject } }` (the top-level fields are the fleet-wide `live_state` row, section 5; `node` is the answering node's memory, including its in-memory live object) |
| `POST /admin/live/republish` | `200 LiveObject` (this node refreshes from SQL, writes the live object, publishes) |

### 4.6 Internal gateway callbacks

`POST /realtime/authorize` and `POST /realtime/message`: contracts in 2.4 and 2.5, protection in 3.5. No credential, no rate limit, `404` empty body when proxied.

## 5. Data model

One schema, `public`, in database `wmsfo_dev` or `wmsfo_prod` on the shared RDS instance. Two roles per environment (`sql.md` section 12): `wmsfo_migrate_<env>` owns the database and runs migrations and the migration tool; `wmsfo_app_<env>` serves every request, tick, and chore and can only select, insert, update, and delete. Both `LOGIN`, `NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE`. The RDS master user creates the database and the roles and is never used by the API. Migrations are EF Core, applied on boot over the migrate connection under `pg_advisory_lock(hashtext('wmsfo_migrations'))`; a node that finds no `snapshot` row after migrating builds version 1 under the same lock and writes the live object. If the version 1 snapshot PUT fails, the node releases the lock, answers `503 unavailable`, and retries the build every 5 s until it succeeds. The live-object PUT on first boot follows the admin-path rule (three attempts one second apart, then `live_state.last_write_error`) and does not gate health.

```

Plain `lat`/`lng` columns; no PostGIS. `seq` is per event from `event.next_seq`, assigned under the event row lock, so seq order is commit order. Soft delete exists only on `cookie` (`hidden_at`); every other delete is hard. The content working set is `page`, `section`, `section_item`, and `site_setting_draft`; `content_version` holds published documents; `media_asset` is the media library; `preview_token` and `icon_library_state` are plumbing. First boot seeds the six role pages and the starter content and publishes version 1 before building snapshot version 1 (sql.md 6 and 8.16).

## 6. Settings (`app_setting`)

| Key | JSON type | Default | Range | Changed by | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `poll_interval_ms` | int | 5000 | 1000 to 60000 | Admin panel | Live object `pollIntervalMs` |
| `cookie_limit_per_person` | int | 10 | 0 to 1000 | Admin panel | `POST /cookies` (inside the transaction), `GET /me/cookies` |
| `sponsor_linger_ms_per_dollar` | int | 40 | 0 to 100000 | Admin panel | Snapshot `sponsors[].lingerMs` |
| `sponsor_linger_min_ms` | int | 2000 | 0 to 600000 | Admin panel | Snapshot `sponsors[].lingerMs` |
| `beacon_stale_after_s` | int | 45 | 15 to 3600 | Admin panel | Stale-beacon chore (7.6); returned as `staleAfterS` on `GET /admin/beacons` for panel colouring (1.11) |

Only `PUT /admin/settings/{key}` changes a value. A missing row means the default. Every settings write is a snapshot-affecting write: the version bump makes every node re-read settings within a tick, and the writing node rewrites the live object so a new `poll_interval_ms` reaches the site. No other configuration lives in the database.

---

## 7. Node runtime

### 7.1 In-memory state per node

`snapshot { version, url }`, `currentEvent { id, statusId } | null`, `activeBeaconId | null`, `latestPublishedLocation | null` (the `location` row fields of the current event), `cookieTally` (map), `settings` (the five keys, refreshed on version change and at least every 5 s), `leader { isLeader, evaluatedAt }`, `lastWrittenVersion`, `wroteForLocationSinceVersionChange` (bool, 7.4). Loaded from the database on boot after migrations; nothing is written on boot unless the `snapshot` table is empty. The outcome of live-object writes lives in the `live_state` row (1.8), not in memory.

### 7.2 Location write (either door)

```
begin;
select id, status_id, next_seq from event where status_id = 3 for update;   -- none: rollback, 409 no_live_event
select is_active, revoked_at from beacon where id = $beacon;               -- revoked: rollback, 401 (REST) or 403 (message path)
insert into location (event_id, beacon_id, seq, recorded_at, received_at, lat, lng,
                      speed_mps, altitude_m, heading_deg, accuracy_m, published)
  values ($event, $beacon, $next_seq, $recordedAt, now(), ..., $is_active);
update event  set next_seq = next_seq + 1 where id = $event;
update beacon set last_seen_at = now(), last_location_at = now(), stale_since = null where id = $beacon;
select version, url from snapshot where id = 1;                            -- carried into the live object
commit;
```

Then respond to the beacon. Then, when `published` is true: update memory (location, snapshot version and URL, event status), build the live object with the tally from memory, PUT `live/location.json`, publish `location` (2.6), set `wroteForLocationSinceVersionChange = true`, update `live_state` (1.8). The publish is attempted whether or not the PUT succeeded. The PUT and publish are not awaited by the beacon's response. A CDN write failure is logged and the response was already `2xx` (the row is stored; the next update retries the object; the hub carried the point). When `published` is false nothing outside the transaction happens.

### 7.3 Snapshot-affecting transaction

```
begin;
select * from snapshot where id = 1 for update;      -- serializes snapshot builders across nodes
... apply the admin write ...
build the snapshot from this transaction's view (1.3);
canonicalize and hash (1.6); key = 'snapshots/' || sha256 || '.json';
PUT s3://<bucket>/<key> with the immutable header;   -- outside SQL; 3 s total timeout, one attempt; failure or timeout => rollback, 502 snapshot_write_failed
update snapshot set version = version + 1, url = '<cdn>/' || key, s3_key = key, built_at = now() where id = 1;
commit;
```

The S3 PUT inside an admin transaction uses a 3 s total timeout and one attempt; fixes waiting on the event row lock therefore wait at most about 3 s. After commit the node refreshes its memory from SQL (snapshot row, current event, active beacon, latest published location, tally, settings), records the new version as `lastWrittenVersion`, writes the live object (up to three PUT attempts one second apart, then `live_state.last_write_error`), and publishes it. Only this node publishes for this version. A rebuild that produces the same bytes reuses the same key; the version still increments. A content publish is this frame with the version insert as the write, so publishes and every other snapshot-affecting write serialize on the `snapshot` row.

### 7.4 Reconcile tick

Every `WMSFO_RECONCILE_TICK_MS` (default 1000) each node runs one round trip:

```sql
select version, url from snapshot where id = 1;
select id, status_id from event where is_current;
select id from beacon where is_active;
select ... from location where event_id = $current and published order by seq desc limit 1;
select cookie_type_id, count(*) from cookie where event_id = $current and hidden_at is null group by 1;   -- every tick in every status
select key, value from app_setting;   -- on version change, and at least every 5 s
```

Memory is refreshed from every row read. When `version` moved and `lastWrittenVersion` is not that version: if `wroteForLocationSinceVersionChange` is true, the node writes the live object once more from the refreshed memory, publishes it, and clears the flag; otherwise it refreshes memory only and neither writes nor publishes (1.8). Every node converges within one tick, and the CDN copy is corrected within one tick when an ingest PUT built before a status change landed after the admin node's PUT.

### 7.5 Leadership

Poll `GET <WMSFO_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_URL>/internal/leader` with `X-Gateway-Realtime-Token: <GATEWAY_REALTIME_TOKEN>` every 2 s with a 1 s timeout. Leader only when the latest answer is `2xx`, `isLeader` is true, and `evaluatedAt` is non-null and under 10 s old. Any non-2xx, timeout, network error, `evaluatedAt: null`, or staleness means follower immediately; `isLeader: true` is never carried across a missed poll. Leadership may overlap for a loop during a hand-off, so every chore is idempotent. `WMSFO_FORCE_LEADER=true` makes the node leader without a gateway (local runs only).

### 7.6 Leader chores (all idempotent)

| Chore | Cadence | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Outbox publish | 2 s | `update outbox set claimed_at = now(), attempts = attempts + 1 where id in (select id from outbox where published_at is null and attempts < 5 and (claimed_at is null or claimed_at < now() - interval '2 minutes') order by id limit 50 for update skip locked) returning *`; process each row per 7.7; on success `update outbox set published_at = now() where id = $1`; on failure set `last_error`. A row that reaches 5 attempts stays unpublished and appears in the logs. |
| Alert send | 5 s | up to `5 * WMSFO_ALERT_SEND_PER_SEC` `alert_delivery` rows with `sent_at` null and `attempts < 5`, oldest first, sent through SES at no more than `WMSFO_ALERT_SEND_PER_SEC` per second; on success set `sent_at`, `ses_message_id`; on failure set `last_error`, `attempts += 1` |
| Stale beacon flag | 15 s | `update beacon set stale_since = now() where revoked_at is null and stale_since is null and last_seen_at is not null and greatest(coalesce(last_heartbeat_at, '-infinity'), coalesce(last_location_at, '-infinity')) < now() - make_interval(secs => <beacon_stale_after_s>)` (a heartbeat or a stored location clears the flag, 4.2 and 7.2) |
| Media orphan collection | 1 h | compute the referenced media id set (working set, every retained `content_version.media_ids`, `sponsor.logo_media_id`, media-sourced `cookie_type.icon`, the site settings draft); set `unreferenced_since = now()` on `ready` rows outside the set that have none, clear it on rows inside the set; tag and mark `orphaned` the rows whose `unreferenced_since` is older than 30 days; untag and return to `ready` any `orphaned` row that is back in the set; delete rows `orphaned` more than 8 days ago (the lifecycle rule removed their objects after 7) |
| Nightly cleanup | 09:00 UTC (02:00 Mountain) | delete `beacon_enrollment_token` rows expired or consumed more than 24 h ago; `outbox` rows published more than 30 days ago (their `alert_delivery` rows cascade with them); `subscriber` rows never verified whose `created_at` is older than 7 days; `beacon_log` rows older than 30 days; `preview_token` rows expired more than 24 h ago; `media_asset` rows still `pending` after 2 days (their objects expired by the lifecycle rule after 1) |

At `WMSFO_ALERT_SEND_PER_SEC` = 10, twenty thousand verified subscribers take about 33 minutes per alert; the SES sending quota must be at or above that rate before the event.

### 7.7 Outbox topics

| Topic | Payload | Written by | Processing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event.status_changed` | `{ "eventId": 7, "fromStatusId": 2, "toStatusId": 3, "notify": true }` | every status change (4.5) | When `notify` is true and `toStatusId` is 2 or 3: for every `subscriber` with `channel = 'email' and verified_at is not null and unsubscribed_at is null`, `insert into alert_delivery (outbox_id, subscriber_id) ... on conflict do nothing`. Template `event_scheduled` (2) or `event_live` (3). Otherwise nothing. |
| `event.message_posted` | `{ "eventId": 7, "messageId": 12 }` | `POST /admin/events/{id}/messages` with `notify: true` | Same fan-out, template `event_message`. When the message or event row no longer exists, mark the outbox row published with `last_error = 'source_deleted'` and send nothing. |
| `subscription.verify` | `{ "subscriberId": 9, "verifyToken": "wsv_..." }` | subscribe and resend-verification | Send template `subscription_verify` to the subscriber's address with `{{verifyUrl}}` = `WMSFO_SITE_BASE_URL/alerts/verify?token=<verifyToken>`. The plaintext token exists only in this outbox row; it is useless after the 24 h expiry and the row is deleted by the nightly chore. No `alert_delivery` row. |
| `contact.received` | `{ "contactMessageId": 12 }` | `POST /contact` | Send template `contact_received` to `WMSFO_CONTACT_NOTIFY_EMAIL` with reply-to set to the sender. |

The `(subscriber_id, outbox_id)` uniqueness is what prevents double sends when leadership overlaps; the alert-send chore sends each row at most once per attempt and never re-sends a row with `sent_at` set.

### 7.8 Email

SES v2 API through the instance role in `<region>`, from `WMSFO_SES_FROM_ADDRESS`, optional configuration set `WMSFO_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`. `<mail-domain>` is DKIM-verified and the account has production access. Hard bounces and complaints are handled by the SES account-level suppression list; the API does nothing further in v1.

Templates live in the API repository at `templates/email/<name>.html` and `.txt` with substitutions `{{eventName}}`, `{{scheduledAt}}` (rendered in `America/Denver`), `{{messageBody}}`, `{{siteUrl}}`, `{{verifyUrl}}`, `{{unsubscribeUrl}}`, `{{contactName}}`, `{{contactEmail}}`, `{{contactMessage}}`.

| Template | Subject | Body must contain |
|---|---|---|
| `subscription_verify` | `Confirm your Santa tracker alerts` | `https://<site-domain>/alerts/verify?token=wsv_...` |
| `event_scheduled` | `Santa's flight is scheduled` | event name, `scheduledAt` in Mountain time, unsubscribe link |
| `event_live` | `Santa just lifted off` | link to `https://<site-domain>/`, unsubscribe link |
| `event_message` | `Santa update: <first 60 characters of body>` | full body, unsubscribe link |
| `contact_received` | `Contact form: <name>` | name, email, message |

Unsubscribe link in the body: `https://<site-domain>/alerts/unsubscribe?token=wsu_...`. Headers on every alert: `List-Unsubscribe: <https://<api-domain>/subscriptions/unsubscribe?token=wsu_...>` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` (section 4.3). Verify tokens are `wsv_` + 43 URL-safe base64 characters, hashed at rest, 24 h; unsubscribe tokens are `wsu_` + 43 characters, stored plaintext, stable for the life of the row.

## 8. Configuration

### 8.1 API container env (the flat JSON `SecretString` of `<secret-name>`)

```json
{
  "ASPNETCORE_URLS": "http://0.0.0.0:5000",
  "WMSFO_ENV": "dev",
  "WMSFO_SERVICE_NAME": "wmsfo-api-dev",

}
```

Prod differs in `WMSFO_ENV` (`prod`), `WMSFO_SERVICE_NAME` (`wmsfo-api`), the database and role names, `WMSFO_SITE_BASE_URL` (`https://<site-domain>`), and `WMSFO_CORS_ORIGINS` (`https://<site-domain>,https://<admin-domain>`).

`GATEWAY_REALTIME_TOKEN` is injected by the gateway and is never placed in the secret. Local-only keys, refused when `WMSFO_ENV` is `prod` and never in the secret: `WMSFO_FORCE_LEADER`, `WMSFO_OBJECT_STORE_DIR` (object store on a local directory), `WMSFO_DEV_STATIC_TOKENS` (fixed test tokens), `WMSFO_SES_DRY_RUN` (log mail instead of sending). AWS credentials come from the instance role via the instance metadata service; locally the SDK default chain applies. Logs are JSON lines on stdout and reach CloudWatch through the gateway. A change to any value propagates as a blue-green container replacement on the next deploy.

### 8.2 Manifest and CI

The manifest entry is in 2.7. CI is GitHub Actions with environments `dev` and `prod`. Branch `dev` deploys `wmsfo-api-dev`; branch `main` deploys `wmsfo-api`.

Flow per push: build the image; push `<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/wmsfo-api:<sha>-dev` (or `<sha>-prod`); obtain a client-credentials token with scope `mgmt/deploy` from `GATEWAY_TOKEN_URL`; then:

```
POST https://<gateway-domain>/mgmt/services/<service>/deploy
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "tag": "<sha>-dev" }
```

Environment secrets: `AWS_ROLE_ARN` (OIDC assume role for the ECR push), `ECR_REPOSITORY`, `GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `GATEWAY_TOKEN_URL`, `GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID`, `GATEWAY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME`. CI never upserts the manifest entry and never sends realtime fields.

### 8.3 Public site (Vercel, `VITE_` prefix)

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_ENV` | `production` or `preview` |
| `VITE_CDN_BASE_URL` | `https://<cdn-domain>` |
| `VITE_HUB_URL` | `wss://<gateway-domain>/hub` |
| `VITE_HUB_CHANNEL_PREFIX` | `wmsfo-api` or `wmsfo-api-dev` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `https://<api-domain>` |
| `VITE_COGNITO_AUTHORITY` | `https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<pool-id>` |
| `VITE_COGNITO_DOMAIN` | `https://<cognito-domain>` |
| `VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` | `<site-client-id>` |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` | referrer-restricted browser key |
| `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID` | set on production only; empty disables analytics |
| `VITE_ANALYTICS_ORIGINS` | comma-separated exact production origins; analytics fires only when the page origin is listed; set on production only |

The site fetches `VITE_CDN_BASE_URL + "/live/location.json"` and otherwise only absolute URLs found in objects. Production deploys from `main`, preview from `dev`.

### 8.4 Admin panel (Vercel, `VITE_` prefix)

`VITE_ENV`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_CDN_BASE_URL`, `VITE_COGNITO_AUTHORITY`, `VITE_COGNITO_DOMAIN`, `VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` (`<admin-client-id>`). Two projects: one deployed from `main` with the prod set at `<admin-domain>`, one deployed from `dev` with the dev set at `<admin-dev-domain>`. Local work runs on `http://localhost:5174` with the dev set in `.env.local`.

### 8.5 Red-Nose (build config per flavour, `dev` and `prod`)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `REDNOSE_DEFAULT_API_BASE_URL` | Prefill for manual enrollment; the enrolled value always wins. |
| `REDNOSE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` | 15000 |
| `REDNOSE_FIX_INTERVAL_MS` | 1000 |
| `REDNOSE_BACKOFF_MS` | `1000,2000,3000,5000` (the last value repeats forever) |
| `REDNOSE_LOG_RING_BYTES` | 2,000,000 |
| `REDNOSE_PROD_API_BASE_URL` | The prod API base URL, present in both flavours; replay (9.4) is offered only when the enrolled `apiBaseUrl` differs from it. |

Runtime-stored fields (Keystore-backed `EncryptedSharedPreferences`), written by enrollment or typed by hand: `apiBaseUrl`, `hubUrl`, `ingestChannel`, `beaconId`, `name`, `role`, `key`, `gpsOnlyFallback` (bool, default false). Dev builds allow cleartext HTTP for a LAN API through the Android network security config; release builds do not.

### 8.6 Platform pieces the contracts assume

| Piece | Requirement |
|---|---|
| S3 bucket | Private; origin access control for the distribution; a CORS rule for `PUT` from the admin origins; two tag-filtered lifecycle rules (`state=pending` 1 day, `state=orphaned` 7 days), per 1.7 and platform.md 1. |
| CloudFront | Per 1.7, with origin access control on the S3 origin. |
| RDS | Databases `wmsfo_dev`, `wmsfo_prod`; roles `wmsfo_app_<env>` (requests) and `wmsfo_migrate_<env>` (migrations, migration tool) per `sql.md` 12. |
| Cognito | Per 3.1, groups `admin` and `editor`. |
| SES | `<mail-domain>` verified with DKIM; production access; sending quota at or above `WMSFO_ALERT_SEND_PER_SEC`. |
| Instance role | S3 `PutObject`, `GetObject`, `DeleteObject`, `ListBucket`, `PutObjectTagging`, `GetObjectTagging`, `DeleteObjectTagging` on `<bucket>` and `<bucket>/live/*`, `snapshots/*`, `routes/*`, `media/*`, `icons/*` (the presigned upload URLs are signed with these credentials, so the role's `PutObject` and `PutObjectTagging` cover the browser's PUT); `ses:SendEmail`; Secrets Manager read of `<secret-name>`; CloudWatch logs; plus `cognito-idp:AdminGetUser` on the pool (TOTP check). |
| Gateway | Manifest entry per 2.7; internal listener reachable at `<docker-bridge-ip>:8080`; load balancer idle timeout at or above 60 s. |

---

## 9. Red-Nose contract

### 9.1 Roles and screens

| Screen | Visible when |
|---|---|
| Enroll (scan or manual) | No stored key |
| Status (name, socket state, live event state, last fix, last receipt, heartbeat age, skew, revoked banner) | Enrolled |
| Debug (full telemetry, fix log, socket log, failure log, upload log button, replay, provisioning state) | Enrolled with `role === "admin"` |

The foreground service starts as soon as a key is stored and on every boot while one is stored. Clearing enrollment (a button on the status screen behind a long press) stops the service and wipes the stored fields.

### 9.2 Service state and loops

The service holds one `LatestFix`, one `Telemetry` value, the last heartbeat answer, and two loops. Nothing is queued; nothing is stored on the phone beyond the current fix.

```
LatestFix { lat, lng, recordedAt, speedMps?, altitudeM?, headingDeg?, accuracyM?, seqLocal }
```

`seqLocal` increments per fix so the send loop knows whether the current fix has been delivered. `recordedAt` is the fix time from the location provider, never the send time. Absent fields are sent as JSON `null`.

Socket loop:

```
attempt = 0
forever:
  start connection; invoke JoinPrivateChannel(ingestChannel, key)
  on success: attempt = 0; socketState = connected; stop HTTP fallback; send the current fix
  on close or failure: stop the connection; socketState = reconnecting; delay = backoff[min(attempt, 3)]; attempt++;
                       wait delay, or until the connectivity callback fires; loop
  a join denied by the gateway: as failure, but the first retry waits 10 s (2.3 step 8)
on channelEvicted(auth_expired): join again immediately, then send the current fix
on channelEvicted(service_removed): join again every 5 s
```

At most one connection exists. A join that throws, including after `auth_expired`, stops the connection and takes the close-or-failure branch (`socketState = reconnecting`, backoff). A retry is never gated on the reported network state: while Android reports no network the service still probes on the 5 s tick, and the connectivity callback only shortens the wait.

Send loop (runs every `REDNOSE_FIX_INTERVAL_MS` and immediately on a new fix; after a failed send the next attempt waits `backoff[min(attempt, 3)]`, and a fix arriving during the wait replaces `LatestFix` and goes out when the wait ends):

```
if no LatestFix or LatestFix.seqLocal == lastDeliveredSeqLocal: return
if a send is in flight: return                                 (at most one in flight on either door)
if socketState == connected:
  invoke SendToChannel(ingestChannel, "location", payload)     (10 s timeout)
  resolved: lastDeliveredSeqLocal = fix.seqLocal; receiptLatencyMs = elapsed; attempt = 0
  rejected: failed send (below); do not fall back (the socket is up)
else:
  POST {apiBaseUrl}/locations with X-Beacon-Key                (10 s timeout)
  2xx: lastDeliveredSeqLocal = fix.seqLocal; httpFallbackSeconds accrues; attempt = 0
  otherwise: failed send (below)
failed send: keep the current fix; next attempt after backoff[min(attempt, 3)]; attempt++
```

`SendToChannel` resolves only after the API answered `2xx`; a rejection is a failed send, the current fix is kept, and the next attempt follows the loop. A `409 no_live_event` (HTTP) or a rejected invoke (hub) is a failed send like any other. A failed send while `lastHeartbeat.liveEventId` is null is logged once per minute at Debug and does not increment `sendsFailedSinceBoot`; `sendsFailedSinceBoot` counts only failures while `liveEventId` is non-null. A fix arriving during an in-flight send replaces `LatestFix` and is sent when that attempt resolves or times out. The service never guesses whether an event is live; `liveEventId` comes only from the API's own answer.

Heartbeat loop: every `REDNOSE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`, `POST /beacons/heartbeat` with the full telemetry, over HTTP whatever the socket state. On a `2xx`: `clockSkewMs = serverTime - (tSend + (tReceive - tSend) / 2)` using the phone's wall clock at request send and response receipt; store `liveEventId` and `isActive`. On a `401`: mark the service state `revoked`, show the banner on the status screen, keep every loop running unchanged (nothing ever gives up; a rotate followed by re-enrollment clears it). Any other outcome (non-2xx other than `401`, timeout, network error) leaves `liveEventId`, `isActive`, and `clockSkewMs` unchanged, is logged with `code` and `requestId` when present, and the next attempt is the next `REDNOSE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` tick; the status screen shows the growing heartbeat age. Skew is telemetry only; it never affects what is sent.

### 9.3 Error surfacing

A hub invoke that throws carries only the gateway's generic text. The debug log records it with the local time and the fix's `seqLocal`. HTTP errors are logged with their `code` and `requestId`. The status screen shows: socket state, `liveEventId` from the last HTTP heartbeat answer (or "no live event"), `active` or `spare` from that answer's `isActive`, last delivered `seqLocal` and receipt latency, heartbeat age, skew, and the revoked banner when set.

### 9.4 Replay mode (admin role)

Input: a route object (1.4) fetched from a URL typed on the debug screen, or a file picked on the phone. The service sends the points in order as fixes with `recordedAt = now()` at a chosen rate (1 to 10 per second) to the enrolled `apiBaseUrl`, `hubUrl`, and `ingestChannel` with the enrolled key. Replay uses the same two doors and the same loops; it differs only in where fixes come from. The debug screen offers replay only when the enrolled `apiBaseUrl` differs from `REDNOSE_PROD_API_BASE_URL` (8.5); replaying into dev means enrolling the phone against dev. Replay against dev with a dev event set live is the end-to-end test of the whole pipeline.

## 10. Migration and cut-over

The one-off tool lives in the API solution (`tools/migrate`), references the API's DTO types and serializer options (1.6), reads the legacy database and bucket by connection strings passed on the command line, takes `--cdn-base-url` (the environment's `WMSFO_CDN_BASE_URL`) for `route.url`, writes only the new database and bucket, and is idempotent by natural key (year for events, sponsor id for sponsors, legacy row id for messages and updates). Every migrated row carries `created_by = 'migration'` where the column exists. Legacy `timestamp without time zone` columns (`sponsors.created_at`, `sponsors.updated_at`, `sponsor_years.registered_at`) are interpreted as UTC on copy. Legacy epoch-millisecond columns (`flight_history.time` bigint; `funds.created` and `messages.created` text) are parsed as milliseconds since the Unix epoch. The year of a legacy row that has no year column is the calendar year of its timestamp in `America/Denver`.

| Legacy | New |
|---|---|
| `flight_history` rows grouped by `year` (2020 to 2025) | One `event` per year: `name` from the `--event-name-format` argument (default `Santa Flyover {year}`), `status_id = 4`, `is_current = false`, `went_live_at` = earliest `time`, `ended_at` = latest `time`, `funds_percent` per the `funds` row below or 0. `location` rows in `seq` order with `seq` renumbered from 1 per event, `beacon_id` = the synthetic beacon, `published = true`, `recorded_at = received_at = time`, `lat`/`lng` from the numeric columns, the optional fields null; `event.next_seq` set to the count plus one. |
| Synthetic beacon | One `beacon` row `name = 'legacy'`, `role = 'beacon'`, a random key generated per 3.2 and discarded, with its `sha256` as `key_hash` and its first 12 characters as `key_prefix`, `is_active = false`, `revoked_at = now()`. |
| 2025 `flight_history` | Also written as `routes/{sha256}.json` (`name = '2025 flight'`, points in `seq` order with `recordedAt` from `time`), a `route` row with `uploaded_by = 'migration'`, linked as the 2025 event's `route_id`. |
| `event_updates` (`id, message, time, created_at`) | `event_message` on the event whose year is the year of `time`, or of `created_at` when `time` is null; `body = message`, `event_time = time`, `created_at` copied. An update whose year has no event is logged and skipped. |
| `sponsors` | `sponsor` with ids preserved (`overriding system value`), columns straight across (`fb_url`, `ig_url` unchanged); the legacy full logo object, when present, becomes a media asset (next row) and `logo_media_id` points at it; after the copy, `select setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('sponsor', 'id'), (select max(id) from sponsor));`. The same `setval` follows the copy of every table whose legacy ids are preserved. |
| Legacy full logo objects (`sponsors.logo_s3_key`) | One `media_asset` per sponsor with a logo: the tool reads the legacy object, runs the API's confirm pipeline on the bytes (sniff, SVG validation, dimensions, variants), writes `media/{uuid}/{filename}` (filename from the legacy key's last segment, sanitized) and the variants to the new bucket with the immutable header, and inserts the row with `state = 'ready'`, `uploaded_by = 'migration'`, `alt` = the sponsor name. Legacy small logos are not copied; the variants replace them. A logo that fails validation is logged and skipped, leaving `logo_media_id` null. |
| `sponsor_years` | `sponsor_year`, same columns; rows with null `sponsor_id` are logged and skipped; null booleans take the column defaults. |
| `sponsor_settings.linger_rate_ms_per_dollar` | `app_setting sponsor_linger_ms_per_dollar` with `updated_by = 'migration'`. |
| `funds` (`percent, id, created`) | For each year of `created`, the row with the greatest `created` sets that year's `event.funds_percent`; `percent` is read through `percent::text` (the cast covers both the `bigint` and the `text` column type the legacy reference lists), parsed as an integer, clamped to 0 to 100; unparseable rows are logged and skipped. |
| `messages` (`email, name, message, created, id`) | `contact_message`: `name`, `email`, `body = message`, `client_ip = ''`, `created_at` from `created`. |
| `tracking_mode*`, `tracki_device*`, `event_mode_override`, `gps_location`, `liftoff` | Not migrated. |

The legacy site's sponsor payload (`id, name, website_url, fb_url, ig_url, logo{full, small, full_url, small_url}, latest_year, active, anonymous, can_advertise, linger, years_as_sponsor`) maps onto `snapshot.sponsors` as `id, name, websiteUrl, fbUrl, igUrl, logoMediaId, latestYear, lingerMs, yearsAsSponsor`; `active`, `anonymous`, and `can_advertise` are the filter in 1.3 rather than fields.

Cut-over order:

1. The legacy API is already stopped and removed from the manifest; the legacy site serves a static snapshot and the legacy database stays readable.
2. Create the new database and roles; deploy the new API to the new manifest entry; it migrates the schema, seeds the role pages and the starter content, publishes content version 1, writes the icon library, and builds snapshot version 1 on boot.
3. Run the migration tool against the new database and bucket.
4. `POST /admin/snapshot/rebuild`.
5. Verify `GET /api/health`, `GET /admin/snapshot`, and `<cdn>/live/location.json`.
6. Point the site and panel env vars at the new API, CDN, and pool; deploy them.
7. Create the new year's event (it inherits the 2025 route), set it current.
8. Editors replace the starter content with the real copy and images through the panel and publish; nothing about the site's text or images lives in a repository.

## 11. Failure modes

| Failure | Effect | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway internal listener unreachable from a node | publishes fail; leader poll fails | The node stores and PUTs normally; the site runs on the poll; the node is a follower, so chores halt until any node sees the listener again. Logged at Warning with a `wmsfo_leader_lost` marker; a CloudWatch metric filter on it alarms when no node has been leader for 60 s. |
| Gateway fleet down | API unreachable on both URLs; hub down | Red-Nose keeps retrying both doors on its backoff; the site polls the CDN and renders the last object. Nothing in the API needs an operator action; the fix is the gateway's. |
| S3 PUT of `live/location.json` fails on the ingest path | CDN lags one fix | Logged; the publish is attempted whether or not the PUT succeeded, so the hub carries the current point; the next fix retries the PUT; the apply rule (1.2) discards the older polled object. |
| S3 PUT of `live/location.json` fails after an admin write | `snapshotUrl` or status not reaching the CDN | Three retries; then `live_state.last_write_error`, surfaced as `lastWriteError` on `GET /admin/live` from every node and rendered red on the dashboard's published-state card (1.11); the admin uses `POST /admin/live/republish`. The hub publish still went out. |
| S3 PUT of a snapshot or route fails | admin write fails | Rolled back; `502 snapshot_write_failed` or `route_write_failed`. |
| Media confirm fails after the upload (variant PUT, tag removal) | asset stays `pending` | `502 media_write_failed`; the panel offers Retry, which calls confirm again (idempotent while pending); an abandoned pending asset expires by lifecycle rule and cleanup. |
| A publish references an asset that is not ready | publish refused | `422 content_invalid` naming the section and path; nothing written. |
| Database unreachable | `GET /api/health` is `503`; every endpoint `500 internal_error` | The gateway keeps routing to the node: its aggregate health never fails the load balancer check and each instance proxies only to its local container. Requests that land on that instance answer `500 internal_error` and hub joins on that instance are denied until the database returns; the site keeps rendering from the CDN. A CloudWatch metric filter on `unavailable` from `/api/health` or on the `500` rate is the operator signal. |
| SES failure | alerts delayed | Per-delivery attempts up to 5, then the row is skipped and visible in the table; the outbox row is retried on its own attempt counter. |
| Backplane degraded | publishes dropped with `202` | The site's poll closes the gap within one interval. |
| Two nodes leader for a loop | chores overlap | Idempotent by `alert_delivery` uniqueness and the outbox claim. |
| Status 3 with no active beacon or a stale one | live screen with no marker | Accepted; the panel's confirmation shows the beacon state before the change; the site renders the waiting state (1.9). |

## 12. Sequence summaries

**A fix reaches a browser (hub path)**: Red-Nose `SendToChannel` to the gateway; gateway `POST /realtime/message` to the API; API runs the location transaction and answers `200`; gateway resolves Red-Nose's invoke; API updates memory, PUTs `live/location.json`, POSTs `/internal/publish`; gateway fans out `ChannelEvent { channel: "<service>:location", event: "location", data }` to every joined browser; the browser applies it.

**A fix reaches a browser (poll path)**: the same until the PUT; the browser's next poll fetches `live/location.json` through CloudFront (one origin read per second per origin at most).

**Admin sets an event live**: `POST /admin/events/7/status { statusId: 3, notify: true }`; the transaction in 7.3 with the history row and outbox `event.status_changed`; commit; the node writes the live object with `eventStatusId: 3` and the new `snapshotUrl` and publishes it; every browser switches to the live screen on the next hub event or poll and fetches the new snapshot; the leader chore fans out `Santa just lifted off`.

**Editor adds a sponsor during the event**: `POST /admin/media/upload-url`, the browser's PUT to S3, `POST /admin/media/{id}/confirm`, then `POST /admin/sponsors` and `PATCH .../{id} { logoMediaId }`, then `PUT .../years/2026`; each sponsor write is a snapshot rebuild and a live-object write; browsers fetch the new snapshot on the next hub event or poll.

**Editor changes the about page**: `PATCH /admin/sections/10 { data }` (draft-validated, nothing published); `POST /admin/content/preview-token` and the preview frame shows it; `POST /admin/content/publish` inserts the version, rebuilds the snapshot with the new `content`, commits, writes the live object with the new `snapshotUrl`; every browser fetches the new snapshot on its next hub event or poll and re-renders the page.

**Person leaves a cookie**: `POST /cookies` with the ID token; the API inserts and increments its own tally; the ingest node re-reads the tally on its next tick (1 s) and its next live-object write carries it.

**Admin hides a cookie during the event**: `POST /admin/cookies/90/hide`; the node re-reads the tally and writes the live object; the leaderboard changes on the next hub event or poll. After the event the same call changes SQL only (4.5).

**Beacon enrollment**: `POST /admin/beacons` returns the key and `enrollment.qrPngDataUrl`; the phone scans `rednose://enroll?api=...&token=...`; `POST /beacons/enroll` returns the key, URLs, and `ingestChannel`; the service starts, joins `<service>:ingest`, and heartbeats.

---

## 13. Shared contract artifacts

The API repository holds `contracts/`:

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `contracts/openapi.json` | The OpenAPI 3.1 document for every REST endpoint in section 4, generated at build time from the API's endpoint metadata and checked in; a CI check fails when the checked-in file differs from the build output. The site and the admin panel generate their client types from it. |
| `contracts/schema/live-object.schema.json`, `snapshot.schema.json`, `route.schema.json`, `location.schema.json`, `heartbeat.schema.json`, `realtime-authorize.schema.json`, `realtime-message.schema.json` | JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for the CDN objects, the two beacon bodies, and the two callback bodies. |
| `contracts/schema/primitives.schema.json`, `content-document.schema.json`, `site-settings.schema.json`, `sections/<kind>.schema.json`, `sections/<kind>.item.schema.json` | The content model (1.3a): the shared primitives (`Icon`, `MediaRef`, `Link`, `Inline`, `Presentation`, `Block`), the document, the site settings, and one publish-level schema per section kind (and per item kind). Hand-written in the API repository; the API loads them at boot for validation and serves them on `GET /admin/content/kinds`; the site and the panel generate types from them and the panel generates its forms from them. |
| `contracts/kinds.json` | The section kind registry: `kind`, `title`, `description`, `live`, `hasItems`, `allowedRoles`, `defaults`, `itemDefaults`, in palette order. |
| `contracts/starter-content.json` | The `ContentDocument` the first boot seeds and publishes as version 1 (with `mediaId` references to nothing, so it uses library icons only). |
| `contracts/fixtures/live-object.json`, `snapshot.json`, `route.json`, `location.json`, `heartbeat.json`, `content-document.json` | Canonical examples, validated against the schemas in the API's tests and consumed by the site's and Red-Nose's tests. `live-object.json` and `snapshot.json` are the canonical (1.6) serialization of the 1.2 and 1.3 examples with concrete values: full 64-character hex keys and `https://cdn.example` as the CDN base. |
| `contracts/admin-thresholds.json` | `{ "batteryLowPercent": 20, "noFixAgeS": 30, "noLocationAgeS": 30 }`, the constants in 1.11 (`staleAfterS` is not one of them; it comes from `GET /admin/beacons`). |
| `contracts/CONTRACTS_VERSION` | An integer bumped on every change under `contracts/`. |

Distribution: the site, admin panel, and Red-Nose repositories each vendor a copy of `contracts/` and a `CONTRACTS_SHA` file naming the API commit it came from; a CI step in each consumer repository fetches that commit's `contracts/` and fails when the copy differs. Updating a consumer is a copy plus a `CONTRACTS_SHA` bump in one commit.

Tests the artifacts drive: Vitest on the site store, page selection, section registry (every kind in `kinds.json` has a component and renders the fixture), inline parser, and `srcset` builder using the fixtures; the panel's form generator against every kind schema; Red-Nose unit tests serializing `LatestFix` against `location.schema.json` and the heartbeat body against `heartbeat.schema.json`; the API's serializer test asserting byte equality between `fixtures/live-object.json` and the API's own output for the same data; Playwright against the preview site and the dev stack walking the status table with the admin API while Red-Nose's replay mode plays the 2025 route.

## 14. Decisions made here

- Bare paths, no version prefix; admin routes under `/admin/*`; the only `/api` path is `/api/health` because the gateway probes it.
- Error shape is the custom `{ code, message, details, requestId }` object, not problem+json.
- Every CDN JSON object carries `schemaVersion: 1` as its first key; an unknown value makes the site stop applying and show a reload prompt.
- The live object is the design's field set plus `publishedAt`. Apply rule: a different event replaces only on a greater `publishedAt`; within one event the site discards a lower `seq`, a null `seq` after a non-null one, and a lower or equal `publishedAt` on equal `seq`.
- The snapshot object carries no `version` or `builtAt` (they stay on the row), so identical data yields identical bytes and the same key.
- Tightened polling is `max(1000, pollIntervalMs / 2)` while live and the hub is disconnected or quiet for `2 * pollIntervalMs`; no extra settings or fields carry it.
- The site switches pages on the live object immediately and renders time-shaped elements blank until the matching snapshot arrives; the signal-lost indicator shows after 30 s without a `seq` change while live, measured with `performance.now()`.
- Only the node that stored a fix, took the admin write, took a moderation while live, or handled the republish writes the live object. A node that sees a version change on the tick refreshes memory only, except one that wrote for a stored location since the previous version change, which rewrites the object once so the CDN copy never stays behind an admin write.
- The live object's PUT and publish are independent: the publish goes out whether or not the PUT succeeded. Admin responses are sent after commit and never wait for the live-object write.
- Live-object write outcome is fleet-wide in the single-row `live_state` table; `GET /admin/live` returns it at the top level and the node's own memory under `node`.
- `seq` is per event from `event.next_seq` under the event row lock; unique `(event_id, seq)` is the only full index on `location` besides the partial published index.
- Only the writing node publishes to the hub; nothing but `location` on `<service>:location` is ever published; `event` and `cookies` are reserved topics.
- Channel prefix is parameterized: `WMSFO_SERVICE_NAME`, `VITE_HUB_CHANNEL_PREFIX`, and `ingestChannel` in the enrollment response.
- The admin panel has a dev deployment from `dev` at `<admin-dev-domain>` and a prod deployment from `main`.
- The admin panel polls (5 s on the dashboard and beacons views) and does not use the hub; its dashboard compares the CDN object with the API and offers Republish on a persistent mismatch; it asks for confirmation before setting status 3 and before rotate, revoke, or deactivate on the active beacon while an event is live.
- The ID token is the bearer on both frontends; person rows are upserted on every authenticated call.
- Admin TOTP is enforced by the API through `AdminGetUser` (`403 mfa_required`), not by an operator procedure.
- Two database roles per environment (`sql.md` 12): migrate owns and migrates, app serves requests.
- Beacon key `wbk_` + 43 base64url chars, SHA-256 at rest with a 12-character display prefix; enrollment token `wet_`, 15 minutes, single use, carrying an AES-256-GCM copy of the key; the API returns a PNG QR rendering; rotation is the only way to get a fresh token; revoke is permanent.
- The hub identity is `"<beaconId>:<keyVersion>"` rather than the bare beacon id, and the message path rejects a stale `key_version`, so a rotate stops the old phone at its next message.
- Heartbeats are HTTP only; the hub carries locations only. The heartbeat answer carries `liveEventId` and `isActive`; a heartbeat `401` shows a revoked banner on the phone without stopping any loop. Send failures before the phone has learned a live event do not count in `sendsFailedSinceBoot`.
- Heartbeat validation is strict on the seven top-level keys and the known leaves, and tolerant of unknown nested keys, which are stored as received.
- `serverTime` is stamped at response serialization after commit; Red-Nose computes skew from the request midpoint.
- SignalR keep-alive 15 s and client timeout 30 s on every client; the load balancer idle timeout stays at or above 60 s.
- Anonymous `SendToChannel` on the public channel reaches the API's no-I/O `403` branch until the gateway forwards client messages only for credentialed joins (gateway backlog).
- The callback endpoints are guarded by the `X-Forwarded-*` check; a gateway-side callback token is a later gateway feature, not a v2 dependency.
- The public-topic authorize branch does no I/O, bypasses the rate limiter, and logs at Debug.
- `hubConnected` on the beacon object comes from the gateway's presence owner API (`GET /internal/presence/<service>:ingest`), one call per beacons request, null when the call fails.
- The stale-beacon flag considers both heartbeats and stored locations, never flags a beacon that has never connected, and is cleared by either.
- `went_live_at` and `ended_at` are re-stamped on every entry into status 3 and 4 respectively, overwriting earlier values; `PATCH` corrects either.
- Entering status 2 requires `scheduledAt` to be set (`409 scheduled_at_required`), and `PATCH` cannot null it while the status is 2.
- `POST /admin/events` takes an explicit `inheritRoute` boolean; route inheritance never depends on a field being absent.
- CDN CORS for reads is a CloudFront response headers policy allowing `*`, with `Origin` out of the cache key; the bucket's only CORS rule admits the admin panel's presigned `PUT` uploads.
- The current event is an explicit `event.is_current` flag set by `POST /admin/events/{id}/current`; nothing derives it from the year.
- `POST /admin/events/{id}/current` on the already-current event is a no-op `200`.
- `latestMessage` is the message with the greatest `created_at`, not `eventTime`; ties go to the greatest `id`.
- Hidden cookies count toward `cookie_limit_per_person`; deleted cookies do not.
- The tally is frozen in `event.final_cookie_tally` on entry into status 4 and carried unchanged by every later live object for that event.
- Anonymous sponsor years are omitted from the snapshot entirely; admin views still show them.
- A sponsor year with `can_advertise = false` is left out of the snapshot entirely, so the sponsor appears nowhere on the site; `canAdvertise` is not a public field.
- The snapshot's sponsor fields keep `fbUrl`, `igUrl`, and `logoMediaId`, plus `latestYear`; `lingerMs` floors at `sponsor_linger_min_ms` (default 2000); logos resolve through the media map and its WebP variants, so there is no separate small logo.
- `POST /admin/routes/from-event/{eventId}` builds a route from an event's published locations; upload remains the other source.
- The route object is `{ schemaVersion, name, points[{ lat, lng, recordedAt }] }` with no other keys, 2 to 50,000 points; a re-upload with identical content returns the existing route; routes can be deleted when unreferenced.
- The S3 PUT inside an admin transaction gets one attempt with a 3 s timeout so fixes never wait longer than that on the event row lock.
- `amountDonated` is a JSON number with two decimals, parsed as decimal by the API and never computed with by clients.
- Every image is a media asset or a library icon; clients render SVG only through `<img>`.
- Status and message writes carry a required `notify` boolean; every status change writes an outbox row; emails go out only for entries into 2 and 3 with `notify` true and for messages posted with `notify` true.
- Alert sending is capped by `WMSFO_ALERT_SEND_PER_SEC` (default 10); outbox rows and deliveries stop retrying after 5 attempts; bounces and complaints rely on the SES account suppression list.
- Verify links land on `/alerts/verify` and unsubscribe links on `/alerts/unsubscribe` on the site, which call the API POSTs; the API's unsubscribe endpoint also reads the token from the query string for RFC 8058 one-click.
- Subscription verification is required even when the address equals the Cognito email; verify tokens are hashed at rest and expire in 24 h, the plaintext travels only in the `subscription.verify` outbox row, and the hash stays on the row after verification so the verify page is idempotent; unsubscribe tokens are plaintext and stable; subscriber addresses are stored lowercased.
- Nightly cleanup runs at 09:00 UTC: tokens 24 h, outbox 30 d (deliveries cascade with their outbox row), unverified subscribers 7 d, beacon logs 30 d; contact messages and cookie notes have no automatic retention.
- Deletes exist for events (no locations, not live), routes (unreferenced), subscribers, contact messages, and people (with their subscriptions and cookies).
- `beacon_stale_after_s` is a setting (default 45) and rides on the beacons list as `staleAfterS`; Red-Nose debug logs live in Postgres, never in the bucket.
- Replay sends to the enrolled API with the enrolled key and is offered only when the enrolled API is not the prod API.
- Migration derives years from `America/Denver` calendar dates, reads `funds.percent` through a text cast, advances identity sequences after copying preserved ids, and takes the event name format as an argument (default `Santa Flyover {year}`).
- One page per event status, plus a no-event page, all admin-composed; the site holds kinds, never screens.
- The content document is the newest `content_version.document` verbatim; identical content publishes to the same snapshot key; `content_unchanged` refuses a no-op publish.
- Working-set writes are draft-validated and never rebuild the snapshot; publish is the only path to the site and is strict.
- The six role pages are seeded, undeletable, and role-immutable; ordinary pages are free; slugs are one segment with five reserved names.
- Presentation, `Icon`, `MediaRef`, `Link`, `Inline`, and `Block` are the only shared vocabulary; kinds never define their own shapes for them.
- Media uploads are presigned PUTs to a private bucket with a pending tag; confirm verifies, derives 480, 960, and 1600 WebP variants, and strips the tag; lifecycle rules expire pending and orphaned objects; orphan collection is a leader chore with a 30-day grace and a 7-day undo.
- Sponsor logos and cookie type artwork are references into the media library and the icon library; there are no per-resource upload endpoints.
- The icon library ships in the API repository and is written to the bucket once per library change under the migration lock.
- Restore loads a version into the working set and publishes nothing; rollback is restore then publish.
- Preview tokens are `wpv_`, 15 minutes, hashed at rest, served through one public endpoint that the site's `/preview` route consumes.
- Two groups, `editor` and `admin`, two policies; both need TOTP.

## 15. Needs a decision

Nothing at the moment. Add here as it comes up.
